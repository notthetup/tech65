<p>I usually don't do unboxing videos on Tech65.org unless it's a brand new product or it's a highly anticipated product, but I thought I'd do one for the LG Prada Phone 2 because the packaging is really well done!</p>
<p>In case you weren't aware, I only got to play with the phone myself (as in put it to the tests) AFTER the filming of <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2009/02/26/g65-10-prada-phone-by-lg/">Episode 10 of Gear65</a>. So here are my thoughts about the device now that I've spent more time with it myself. In summary: The watch and the Prada brand are the only reasons why you'll want to get this phone. Even if you had all the money in the world.<!--more--></p>
