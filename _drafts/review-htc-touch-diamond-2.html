<p>Got my hands on the HTC Touch Diamond 2. Wait, before you run to the nearest Telco shop to buy, let me say that it will only be launched in the market somewhere in mid May. I'm fortunate to get my hands on the review unit before it hits the stores, thanks to Gina from The Right Spin for making this possible.</p>

<p>Its fun doing review for a unreleased product. While using it on the train, starbucks and McDonalds, I notice a few people keep looking at the phone. I guess they must have figured out that its the unreleased HTC Touch Diamond 2.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dk.sg/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dsc04800.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc04800-300x224.jpg" alt="dsc04800" title="dsc04800" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4079" /></a><br />
(PS: The white circles are actually reflections from the lights above)</p>
<p>The HTC Touch Diamond 2 looks stunning. The combination of metal and plastic makes the phone looks good and at the same time keeps the phone light. Unlike the first generation of HTC Touch Diamond, the Touch Diamond 2 does not have those cool looking lines at the back of the phone. (OK, I know this is subjective. I personally find the lines at the back of Touch Diamond 1 nice, but there are folks out there who thinks its ugly.) But the back is a fingerprint magnet. Oh well, it seems like good looks and fingerprint magnet goes hands in hands.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought that there won't be much changes to the hardware specs. I was so wrong. Almost everything that can be improved has been improved on the 2nd Generation. You get 512MB ROM and 288MB RAM. 3.2 inch touch sensitive screen with 480 x 800 WVGA resolution. 5.0 megapixel camera with auto focus. GPS, WIFI, Bluetooth and HSDPA. All these on a 10.785 x 5.31 x 1.37 cm size weighing just 117.5g.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dk.sg/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dsc04805.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc04805-224x300.jpg" alt="dsc04805" title="dsc04805" width="224" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4081" /></a></p>
<p>While the specs looks pretty good, the best part about this phone is actually the TouchFLO 3D interface that is found on most HTC Window Mobile phone. As most of you already know, I'm not a fan of Windows Mobile. But if you die die must force me take a Windows Mobile phone, I would prefer it to come together with TouchFLO 3D. And the latest version of TouchFLO 3D that is on the Touch Diamond 2 is so good that I almost forgot that this device is running on Windows Mobile 6.1. In fact, the TouchFLO 3D almost replaced all the interface on Windows Mobile 6.1 with their own interface. Cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dk.sg/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dsc04808.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc04808-224x300.jpg" alt="dsc04808" title="dsc04808" width="224" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4082" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspect of the TouchFLO 3D interface is that it is "People Centric". Unlike other phone interface where its mostly about application, the TouchFLO 3D is about people. The address book is called "People". From there, you can see the contact info about the person in your address book and also all your past conversation history (Email, SMS and call log). From the same People page, you can also contact the person via Email, SMS or a call. Its an interesting way to look at how you organise your contact in your phone. In the past, we organise it base on application (Email application, SMS application, Phone application). But on the TouchFLO 3D interface, it organise contact by grouping everything under the person's contact.  </p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dk.sg/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dsc04811.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc04811-224x300.jpg" alt="dsc04811" title="dsc04811" width="224" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4084" /></a></p>
<p>The TouchFLO 3D on the HTC Touch Diamond 2 also includes new interface for the calender. One useful feature on the calendar is that it includes the weather forecast. This is specially useful if you are planning some outdoor activities for the next few days. Else there is no harm having some extra information about the weather.</p>
<p>The TouchFLO 3D also remove the stupid Windows Mobile bar that you see when you click the start button. Instead, you go straight to the program page when you click on the Start button. </p>
<p>At this point, you might be wondering why does HTC still bother using Windows Mobile 6.1 when their interface has almost overridden everything? Why not just make TouchFLO 3D runs on its own? Well, the good thing about having Windows Mobile as the backbone is that you can tap on the wide range of applications written for Windows Mobile. </p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dk.sg/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/dsc04813.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc04813-300x224.jpg" alt="dsc04813" title="dsc04813" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4085" /></a></p>
<p>The zoom in and out on the HTC Touch Diamond 2 is different from the first generation. In HTC Touch Diamond, you move your finger in circular motion to zoom in and out. For HTC Touch Diamond 2, there is a zoom in and out bar at the bottom of the screen for user to swipe left and right to zoom. I would say that I prefer this method compared to the circular motion. (Although I still feel that the best gesture is the multi touch pinching)</p>
<p>Oh, before I forget, the HTC Touch Diamond 2 is Windows Mobile 6.5 compatible. How we know? Because Microsoft demo-ed Windows Mobile 6.5 on a HTC Touch Diamond 2 when it was being announced. And from what I understand, all Touch Diamond 2 users will get a free Windows Mobile 6.5 upgrade when it is released.</p>
<p>The HTC Touch Diamond 2 will be available from mid May 2009 and retail at S$1088 without contract.</p>
