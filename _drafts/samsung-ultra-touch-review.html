<p>Every mobile phone has its strengths and weaknesses, and each phone is designed for different types of people. Let's take a detailed look at the Samsung Ultra Touch and find out what kind of user it is designed for.</p>
<p>Specifications at a glance: 3.5G phone with video call support, 8.0 mega-pixel camera with auto focus and LED flash, capacitive touch screen combined with a sliding numeric keypad, OLED display, expandable and comes with an 8GB microSD card.</p>
<p><!--more--><strong>Design<br />
</strong>I really love the design of this phone. It's sleek and slim, fits well in my hand and in my pocket. It's got a really clean design with the buttons well placed and its only port covered with a plastic flap when not in use. I really love the colour scheme of the phone too, with its gun metal black and maroon trim. It's got a really awesome balance of cool and class. It'd look good both at a business meeting as well as at a party.</p>
<p>I also like the way it hides the camera and flash behind the slider, and when you open the slider, the red (and the right shade of red, I might add) just reveals itself with a carbon-fibre looking pattern. Speaking of slider, I noticed that unlike most slider phones, this phone maintains the shape of the body even with the slider open. In other words, the phone looks more like it's expanding than splitting into half. That was a really nice touch.</p>
<p>The numeric keypad also has an interesting design. Even though it's curved, the buttons have a lining on them that guides your fingers together with the curve. I personally found the buttons a little too stiff, but everyone has their personal preferences and as all keypads and controls, always try them for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Display<br />
</strong>So many things about this phone shouts (or elegantly speaks in a loud volume) beautiful, and the display is one of them. This must be the most beautiful display I've ever seen! That's thanks to the fact that it's an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) display. In layman terms, an LCD display works like the traditional transparency. A thin film displays all the colours and a back-light shines though it. The problem is that it shines through everything, including black. As a result, black appears grayish to the eye. OLEDs on the other hand, work by having each pixel on the display produce its own light. As such, black is created by not producing any light at all. This creates a really black "black", resulting in high contrast and rich colours. Add that to the fact that the display is quite big, and you get a truely beautiful display.</p>
<p>Another feature of the display is that it claims to have an anti-scratch coating on it. I haven't tried it myself but I'll take their word for it.</p>
<p>Oh, and I guess I don't have to mention that like almost every touchscreen phone display today, it's super glossy and a huge finger print magnet.</p>
<p><strong>Camera<br />
</strong>The camera is pretty impressive too.</p>
<p><strong>Capacitive Touch Screen<br />
</strong>The Ultra Touch is using a capacitative touch screen like that found on the iPhone, rather than a resistive one. This means that you don't have to put pressure on the screen. However, how well a capacitive screen works depends on how well the software is designed. To be fair, the touch screen is quite usable, and to most people, they will have no problems using it.</p>
<p>However, the scrolling in the phone feels sluggish, and I end up using the volume keys to scroll through long menus as it turns out to be faster and smoother than using your finger. Also, it is not very precise. In fact, to make up for the lack of precision, the web browser requires you to tap onto a link twice to confirm you are clicking on the correct link before it will bring you to it.</p>
<p><strong>TouchWiz (The User Interface)<br />
</strong>To me, the user interface is how you differentiate a power user phone and a casual user phone, and the Samsung Ultra Touch is certainly a casual user phone. The phone is designed to be clean and pretty rather than giving you as much information as possible. However, if you <em>do</em> want to have more information, you can make use of the TouchWiz UI's main attraction, the widgets panel on the standby screen. The widgets screen basically allows you to customise your "desktop" to have as much information as you need. Everything on the desktop is a widget, even the operator name! Also, the standby screen actually slides, a little like how Google Android's standby screen on the HTC Dream slides.</p>
<p>It sounds complicated, but I'll give you an example on how I used it. On the top of the screen, I placed a clock, the events widget that shows me my upcoming events from my calendar, as well as a short cut to "New SMS". While at the bottom of the standby screen, which is hidden until I drag it down, I placed a short-cut to the phone profiles (for quick silent mode or outdoor mode switching) as well as a short cut to the bluetooth manager, two features I used often, but not often enough for me to look at all the time. That's the kind of practical things you can do with the widgets.</p>
<p>The thing about the TouchWiz user interface, however, is that it's still quite new. There are many things that the user interface is still not able to do, or is still inconsistent at doing. Take the accelerometer for example. In the File explorer, when you open an image, the phone responds when you rotate the phone by rotating the picture appropriately, and supports all four directions, straight up, tilting the phone left or right, even upside-down. But when you open the web browser, it only responds in two orientations, straight or tilt left! In fact, quite strangely, when you rotate the phone towards the right, the screen still rotates towards the left, making the web page upside-down to you!</p>
<p><strong>The Web</strong><br />
Speaking of the browser, it's actually quite alright. It's able to render most pages correctly, and is capable to loading huge webpages too. I'd recommend you stick to mobile websites on this device though, as it doesn't reformat huge pages, thus reading requires lots of scrolling. It may not be the fastest, but it's far from the slowest browser too.</p>
<p>I do have a few issues with the browser though:<br />
1. while in the rest of the phone the volume key allows you to scroll up and down, in the browser the volume keys become the zoom key. It also doesn't help that the zoom keys reverse when you rotate the phone, the zoom keys reverse (i.e. Vol up is zoom in when upright, but zoom out when tilted left).<br />
2. typing URLs on this phone is quite difficult, though this is the case for most number-pad phones. It would really help if they added shortcuts for http://, www and .com, as well as make the "/" easily accessible.</p>
<p>Then again, this phone isn't a power-user phone, so most buyers from their target audience would hardly use it.</p>
<p><strong>Text Input<br />
*</strong>Disclaimer: I am a qwerty-keyboard user, and haven't used number-pad phones for years*<br />
The T9 in the phone is pretty standard, and works the same whether you use the on-screen keypad when the slider is closed or the physical keypad. You would think that they would add different input methods, possibly even a Qwerty keyboard when rotated, but I believe the screen size has something to do with the lack of other input methods.</p>
<p>One thing I got quite annoyed with the T9 on this phone, however, was the shift key. Even though this phone has a shift key, it's actually rotating between "First letter caps", "All Caps", "All no caps" and "numbers". As a result, when I try to type a sentence like "Hi, my name is Daniel", it does everything right until I press the shift key again for D, and I end up typing numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity<br />
</strong>This phone has everything you would expect a flagship model to have: Bluetooth, GPS (though you can only use it with a java version of Google Maps and the camera), USB, HSPDA. Everything except Wifi. There hasn't been a single TouchWiz phone on the market as of yet that comes with WiFi, which has led me to believe that it probably has something to do with the TouchWiz software.</p>
<p>In terms of Bluetooth, I'm happy to say that it's quite fully featured. You can use this as a tethered modem with any computer. You can also stream music to any A2DP speakers or headphones, as well as send or recieve files. In fact, this phone uses a new and updated method of pairing with a computer. While older phones require you to come up with a pairing key on both the phone and the computer, which most users just type 1234, this phone simply comes up with the number, sends it to the computer, and asks you to just make sure that it's the same on both sides. This ensures the connection is secure, while reducing steps for the user.</p>
<p>The USB port is also quite feature filled. It uses a standard microUSB cable rather than a properitary one. You can charge, use it as a media device with Windows, as a card reader for the 8GB microSD card, or use it with its PC suite. If you're a Mac user, however, you might want to reconsider getting this phone as other than charging, nothing else work with it. Not even the card reader. This means that without iSync, you can't easily transfer your entire address book from your previous phone to this one if you own a Mac.</p>
