<p>Competition in the smartphone market has never been hotter, what with the Apple, Android, Palm, Series60, Windows Mobile... you get the idea. So how do you decide which is the right smartphone for you? Here are some suggestions to make sure you don't end up wasting precious money on your next phone.</p>
<p>Your phone is likely going to be that one gadget that you carry with you everywhere you go, so picking the right phone for you is very important. Time to look past all that marketing and get a phone that's really designed for your lifestyle. In order of importance, here are some suggested things to look out for:</p>
<p>1. Software: Usage</p>
<p>This is the most important thing to take note when you look for a phone. It is also something that people under-estimate and often forget. The guys at GDGT said it best: there's no point in compromising something that you use heavily just for a pretty phone.</p>
<p>Think about what you are going to use this phone for.</p>
<p>For example, I'm a heavy Gmail user. I'll have to find out if the phone supports the mobile Gmail app (which is most Series60 phones), or even better, if the phone's email client supports Gmail conversations (Like the Android phones). If not, if the phone has a standard IMAP/POP email client: Are you willing to give up Gmail conversations and tags for your phone? I also use Google calendars heavily, and I subscribe to calendars related to my work. Can the phone support multiple calendars? And can it update itself when changes are made online? Do I need it to sync over the air, or can I manage by syncing with my computer when I get home every day. I am going to use my phone to research for stories for 65bits too. Can the phone switch between the web browser and the word processor or notepad easily? While I'm at it, does it even have a word processor? Can it copy and paste? Does it support Qik for live streaming?</p>
<p>My example is pretty extreme, but I hope you get the idea.</p>
<p>That brings me to another point as well. There's no point in asking for something that doesn't exist today (Can it control my car remotely and help me find a parking lot?), so the way I do it is lay out all the potential phones that I'm interested in, sort my needs by order or importance, then try and fit these phones into those requirements and pick the one that fits best. Otherwise, if they don't fit into any phone, and you don't need a new phone that badly, just wait for someone to make one!</p>
<p>Remember: Settle your needs and requirements first before looking into the cool extra features the phone can provide.</p>
<p>2. Software: Speed</p>
<p>What's the point of getting a phone that can do everything you need it to do, but take about ten minutes to load each application? This is especially so for phone that can multi-task. Are you able to end a task after you're done with it? The Android phones, for example, don't have a task manager that lets you end a task (yet), so the longer you use the phone without shutting down, the slower the phone will be. Most phones today shouldn't have that problem today, but just make sure. Don't be too demanding though. As long as you're ok with the amount of time something loads, then it's ok. Don't expect applications in phones to launch instantly.</p>
<p>3. Eco-system</p>
<p>4. Design</p>
<p>The look of the phone<em> is</em> important, but what I want to focus on here is actually the comfort of the phone. This is where playing with a real phone or a model really helps. Different people have different hands and different body sizes, so this is something that reviews can't always help. If you hear us mention such things in our reviews or Gear65 videos, don't take our word for it, make sure you try it out yourself to see if it applies to you too.</p>
<p>You're going to be using this phone all day, so you want to make sure that the keypad or keyboard is comfortable to type on. Watch out for parts on the phone that your fingers keep hitting (especially for sliding phones), and for awkward angles your fingers makes to reach a key when you type a message. The amount of force needed to push a key is also a factor to look out for. Some keypads are very stiff, and can be very uncomfortable to type on after a while. If the phone has a keyboard, make sure you can touch-type easily. This is usually determined by the gap between the keys, as well as the way the keys protrude out of the phone. If you can't touch-type on the phone, then there's no point in a keyboard, now, is there? It is very important to remember, though, that just because you're not used to using a new keypad, keyboard or touch screen doesn't mean that it's uncomfortable. Many of them take some time to get used to using it (it's a brain thing, not a physical thing), and once you're used to it, you'll realise how easy and fast it is to type on it compared to when you first tried it.</p>
<p>The next thing to look our for is how it fits in your hand, especially if you have small hands. If the phone is so wide that you can't even hold it, you better think again about that phone. Oh, and don't forget to try it in your pocket. Again, this is if you have a small build. If it won't fit comfortably in your pocket, you better carry a hand bag, or look some more.</p>
