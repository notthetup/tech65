<h2>About The Hosts</h2>
<p><strong>Daniel Tsou</strong> is our fabulous host, who decides mostly what we talk about and basically calls the shots, Yes, he does. I, writer of this bio on Mr Tsou is very much afraid that by commiting this post to words, I will be dragged off in the night by a black Truck, or a Segway more like. Other than that, Daniel is attached, tall, lived for a period of time in Venezuela, and is enthusiastic for all things tech.</p>

<p><strong>Jerrick Lim</strong> the deliciously tall and thoroughly lickable international correspondent has for two years served faithfully at our corporate headquarters in Singapore. However with his insanity and subsequent decision to go off and pursue the awkward profession of legal letters, has departed our fair shores and now reports from the isle of Great Britain. Occasionally, he pops on an aircraft and makes the long and arduous journey in a metal tube home, where he would contribute to our programmes with continued gusto and fervour.</p>

<p><strong>NTT</strong> is our Indian podcaster *Tech65 is an equal opportunity employer and we welcome people of all creeds, orientations, Operating Systems* We recently welcomed him to our Tech65 family and could not have been more happy with this adoption. NTT brings with him a knowledge of things Podcast, and things Tech and once in a while even gives us free publicity with which we are immensely grateful for! NTT also brings to this podcast facial hair, which our Chinese podcasters are sorely lacking in.</p>

<p><strong>Farinelli </strong>the host who has resigned himself to the glorious and noble task of communications. He shares a love of audio with NTT, and as such appreciates a curiously wide range of musical styles. After much verbal slapping by Jerrick he has finally earned the right to legitly call himself a Mac fanboy by acquiring the latest Macbook Pro, which he shamelessly boasts as the most powerful machine Tech65 has in their grubby possession. Farinelli has an interest in all forms of media editing, and hopes to be unearthly proficient in it soon. He is stuck in Stagmont Camp during weekdays, paying his share of the price of peace.</p>

<p><strong>Kai Yi </strong>is our youngest podcaster and has motor oil for blood. His voice of moderation and general inability to resist a nice cuppa has also resulted in him becoming our first Tech65 casualty, bravely sacrificing his laptop to the evil menaces of spilt hot coffee. Not the kind we find in certain video games, but actual hot coffee, Courtesy of Geek Terminal, Empowered by Technology, Inspired to Achieve. (Ed: Can we have our free coffees now?) His motor oil blood has been good for distracting NTT from his PHP talk, and whatever else it is the purist geeks talk about and also makes a very interesting party conversation starter. His youth has also ensured that he is always the one picking up stuff for us that our old backs can hardly manage anymore, and he is also expected to support us into our old age, when we are infirm and unable to attend to ourselves at a ripe old age of 25.</p>
