<p>This episode, which heralds the long awaited departure and possible guillotining at the stake of the HD-DVD. We also see the price halving of the iPod Shuffle, a piece of news almost as tiny as its actual namesake. We're also enthused by the announcement of Command and Conquer Red Alert 3, the titanic series of games from Electronic Arts. Speaking of games, we'll see Microsoft's Zune getting games developed on the XNA platform, a development that as great as it sounds will only give the Zune a small advantage over the iPod, but somehow one that'll never be enough. And, finally seeing as the time has come for the lot of us the Tech65 crew to take a break and relax, and what better 21st century way to do so than to get advice from Wikitravel, now available in a book form. Yes, life is good even though HD-DVD is dead, being replaced by the Blue blooded Blu-ray. </p>
<p>Yours with love,<br />
Chasity and Innocence</p>
