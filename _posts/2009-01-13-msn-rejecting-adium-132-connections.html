<p>If you are using <a href="http://adiumx.com/">Adium</a> for MSN, you will most likely notice that you can't connect to MSN today. It appears that MSN has rejected Adium 1.3.2 and Pidgin connections.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Taken from <a href="http://adiumx.com/blog/2009/01/msn-rejecting-adium-132-connections/">Adium's blog</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Starting at about 20:00 PST tonight (January 11), Microsoft’s servers have stopped accepting logins from clients that use version 15 of the protocol, including Adium 1.3.2. The Debug Window in debug and beta versions of Adium reveals that their server is failing to find a certificate that it needs when <a href="http://adiumx.com/faq/LibPurple">Libpurple</a> attempts to retrieve your MSN Address Book.</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering, this also affects <a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>, which means it’s definitely not an Adium problem.</p>
<p>There are two ways to connect:</p>
<p>Use <a href="http://microsoft.com/mac/products/messenger/">Microsoft Messenger for Mac</a>, the official client.<br />
Use <a href="http://adiumx.cachefly.net/Adium_1.3.1.dmg">Adium 1.3.1</a>, the previous version of Adium.<br />
We’re not sure whether this is a temporary server problem or a permanent change that will break P15-using Libpurple-based clients (including Adium 1.3.2) until a future Libpurple release. If it turns out to be the latter, we’ll almost certainly include that Libpurple update in our next 1.3.3 beta.</p></blockquote>
<p>We will keep you updated if there is any new developments. In the meantime, try using the official Microsoft Messenger for Mac or Adium 1.3.1 to access MSN on MacOS.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The problem has been resolved. <a href="http://adiumx.com/blog/2009/01/msn-now-working-again/">Adium 1.3.2 is able to connect to MSN</a> now.</p>
