<p>Many many apologies loyal readers. This week's podcast has to be delayed as both of our editors could not find time outta their busy schedules to get together to post one up. We at Tech65 apologise and hope that you our dear readers can find it in your hearts to either forgive us or send us a Lamborguini. Laptop. Model. Er... how about just a button from a Lambo? No? Ah well, we try.</p>
<p>Love Came Again,<br />
