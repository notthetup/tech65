<p>Reviewing the Belkin N750 have been pretty fun. There are a lot of controls in it but it can all be used simply too. The best way to start is by inserting the installation setup CD (I will be giving the link for direct download of the software if for some reasons you do not have cd-rom drives in any of your computers). You may also wish to view the Unboxing video for Belkin N750 DB at <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2011/11/02/unboxing-belkin-n750-db-wifi-router/">http://www.tech65.org/2011/11/02/unboxing-belkin-n750-db-wifi-router/</a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/N750_WirelessDualBand_N%252B_Router.jpg" alt="" width="187" height="224" />Let's cover the basics of what this router can do.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MultiBeam Technology</strong><br />
High-powered signal for multiple devices</li>
<li><strong>Dual-Band Speed</strong><br />
Up to 300Mbps (2.4GHz) + 450Mbps (5GHz)*</li>
<li><strong>2 USB Ports</strong><br />
For wireless printing and storage</li>
<li><strong>4 Gigabit Ports</strong><br />
For ultra-fast file sharing</li>
<li><strong>Easy Setup</strong><br />
EASY START gets you set up in 3 easy steps</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MultiBeam Technology</strong></p>
<p>This is a technology exclusive to  Belkin. It's antenna technology gives you powerful signal strength and maximum coverage so you can connect from multiple devices, virtually anywhere in your home.</p>
<p><strong>Dual-Band Speed</strong></p>
<p>Deriving and benefiting from the MultiBeam Technology is the use of Dual-Band Speed. In this regard, even when we talked about Wireless N - the speeds can range between 300Mbps to 450Mbps. It is still backward compatible to devices that can run at 54Mbps &amp; 11Mbps. This is achieved by providing both 2.4Ghz &amp; 5Ghz bandwidth. Additionally, there is a option to enable Guest Access that is isolated from your main network. Guest Access is self-explanatory, it just mean that you can share your internet connection without risking intrusion into your personal infrastructure at home.</p>
<p><strong>2 USB Ports</strong></p>
<p>I am delighted with this feature as I can now easily use both my External HDDs with the Belkin set-up. I did not have the opportunity to use the Printer access mode. A welcomed improvement would be that the USB connections run on 3.0 speed.</p>
<p><strong>4 Gigabit Ports</strong></p>
<p>A complete networking experience should come with the fastest on the wire connections. Yes the wireless infrastructure is great but nothing can beat the Gigabit speeds the ports provided especially when I needed to transfer videos for my Tech66 productions from one computer to another.</p>
<p><strong>Easy Setup</strong></p>
<p>You need not be a geek to set-up the Belkin router. Running the software gives you an easy way to set-up the router. Guest Access is disabled by default but once you get the hang of it, everyone options can be made simpler for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Installation via WPS" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/N300_WirelessNRouter.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="240" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Using the WPS function is one of the simpler set-up methods you can use. This is especially useful when connecting smart phones, be it IOS, Android, Symbian, Windows Phone 7 or even RIM phones.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/BelkinSetup.PNG" alt="" width="581" height="413" /></p>
<p>Providing the clearest visual description can simplify your network needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/BelkinGetConnected.PNG" alt="" width="582" height="419" /></p>
<p>Once you have settled the hardware set-up, just go ahead and launch the software set-up.</p>
<p>The Belkin N750 DB WIRELESS DUAL-BAND N+ ROUTER is available for retail in Singapore at the price of $229.00 and commercially available now in Singapore at major retailers like Best Denki, Courts, Harvey Norma, Challenger, Mustafa, IT Malls and Gain City. You may head on to this <a href="http://www.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=543388" target="_blank">site</a> to check out even more details on the router capability. There are other routers offered by Belkin, even the lower specifications will still sport the MultiBeam Technology.</p>
<p>The Belkin N750DB I reviewed was tested in a typical HDB 4-Room apartment with many concrete partitions. I placed the router at the living room and at the furthest point of the house, I can still receive a full signal bar.</p>
