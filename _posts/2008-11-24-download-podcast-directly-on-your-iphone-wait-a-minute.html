<p>Remember <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2008/11/09/65bits-episode-95-touchsmart-has-a-fan-club/">Episode 95</a> when we talked about the downloading podcast directly on your iPhone feature which is expected to be released with firmware 2.2? Apple released the much awaited iPhone firmware 2.2 update on 20th Nov. I installed it on my iPhone the moment I book out from my reservist.</p>
<p>The first feature I tried is the podcast downloading feature. That is one of my biggest wishlist for iPhone. So I went to the iPod applications, click to 65 bit podcast (Shameless plug) and at the bottom of the page is feature to "Get More Epsiodes..."</p>

<p>I click on it and the iPhone switches over to iTunes and...... <strong>*BANG*</strong>.</p>

<p>"Cannot Connect to the iTunes Store. The iTunes Store is not supported in this country"</p>
<p>Brilliant. Simply brilliant. Which means those who are living in countries without iTunes Store (like Singapore) still will not be able to download podcast directly from their iPhone. Let's hope its just a minor oversight.</p>
<p>Other bug fixes and enhancements on firmware 2.2:</p>
<li>Enhancements to Maps</li>
<ol>
- Google Street View</ol>
<ol>
- public transit and walking directions</ol>
<ol>
- display address of dropped pins</ol>
<ol>
- share location via email</ol>
<li>Enhancements to Mail</li>
<ol>
- resolved isolated issues with scheduled fetching of email</ol>
<ol>
- improved formatting of wide HTML email</ol>
<ol>
- improved stability and performance of Safari</ol>
<li>Podcasts are now available for download in iTunes application (over Wi-Fi and cellular network) </li>
<li>Decrease in call set-up failures and call drops</li>
<li>Improved sound quality of visual voicemail messages</li>
<li>Pressing the Home button from any Home screen takes you to the first Home screen</li>
<li>Preference to turn on/off auto-correction in Keyboard Settings  </li>
