<p>I'm really sorry to announce that last week's episode, episode 27, will not be up in time due to unforseen circumstances. A broken internet connection prevented the episode from getting uploaded in time on Sunday night, so we tried to get it up on Monday afternoon, hoping at the same time that we can attract the afternoon crowd on Ping.sg only to discover that the hard disk which the podcast was on had died completely, thus causing all it's data, along with the podcast, to be lost.</p>
<p>Episode 27 is still in the iPod, however, as last week was the first time we decided to try doing the show in stereo. However, as I am still in camp with my iPod, we are unable to get it up before the week is over.</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for depriving you listeners an episode this week, and hope we will still see you guys again next week.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p>Daniel, Jerrick, NTT</p>
