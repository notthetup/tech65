<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>We at Tech65 have always believed that what we're doing is part of giving something back to the community, as fun as it is to do 65bits every week and as great it is to just sit around and hang out *aka Podcast*. We thought we'd take it all one BIG step further and participate in the  <a href="http://www.science.edu.sg/">Science Centre's</a>'s "Month of Science'08". Here are the details.</p>
<p><strong>What?</strong> - Workshop on Podcasting<br />
<strong>Where?</strong> - Science Center<br />
<strong>When? </strong>- Monday, 1st Sept, 1pm<br />
<strong>How much?</strong> - Free!<br />
<strong>How to register?</strong> - <a href="http://www.sciencemonth.org.sg/special.asp">http://www.sciencemonth.org.sg/special.asp</a></p>
<p>The Crew will be there to give you guys a nice look into the basic production of a podcast and how YOU can do it too! It'd be a great time for you guys to hang out with us. And we'd like to get to know you, our listeners, so much better! So come on down and support the podcast you love!</p>
<p>Cya guys there!!</p>
<p>-Tech65 Crew.</p>
