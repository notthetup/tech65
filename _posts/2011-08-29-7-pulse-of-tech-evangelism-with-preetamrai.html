<p>When I first met Preetam more than 4 years back, I was struck by his travels and down-to-earth ways of connecting with people and technology everywhere he went. When he was back in Singapore recently, I had to nudge him for a meetup to know more about how he got started and his thoughts on his work for tomorrow.</p>
<p>He still continues to travel widely, while spreading the culture of open sharing and technology through unconference events like <a href="http://barcamp.org/w/page/402984/FrontPage">Barcamp</a> in the region of South East Asia. Needless to say, my biggest takeaway was how he connected zen with technology. Let's hear the chat I had with him on a quiet Saturday evening at the <a href="http://hackerspace.sg/">Hackerspace Singapore</a>! And oh! He passed me his lovely Samson U01C microphone - Thanks a bunch!</p>
