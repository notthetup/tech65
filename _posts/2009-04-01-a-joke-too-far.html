<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>As you already know, the crew at Tech65.org played a <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2009/03/31/management-reshuffle/">prank</a> on all of you in the <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2009/04/01/frantic-melee-tech65-headquarters/">last 24 hours</a>. It started out as a joke that the crew was going to be replaced by monkeys, but quickly went out of hand. Some people, after realising it was a joke, became upset about this joke.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Tech65 has always treasured the bond between our friends and closest audience members, we admit that the execution for this joke was not thoughtfully planned out and certainly some of these criticisms hit home quite close to the heart. But rest assured that YOU, are still our HIGHEST priority. We, as a team are still highly committed to bringing you the best and the greatest that Tech has to offer and nothing will change that. Know that ultimately, we wanted to hire "monkeys" because they were "better qualified", to IMPROVE this website.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought that these people didn't have a sense of humour. However, I later realised that we weren't posting a fake story, or some humorous harmless feature, but messing with people's emotions. I put myself in your shoes, and realised that I too would have been upset about it. Many of you, personal friends of the members of the crew, were genuinely concerned, and some even worried, about the welfare of the crew and the website, and when I thought about it, I realised that we did, unintentionally, in fact <em>cheat</em> you of that feeling. All we wanted was to make people laugh today.</p>
<p>For that, I offer my sincere apology on behalf of the entire Tech65.org crew. I am not offering this apology for the sake of our reputation, but for the sake of the friendships we have bonded in the past 3 years. This site, like all material things, has a limit. But our friendships forged are eternal. We should have thought better than to mess with something of eternal value.</p>
<p>If you were offended, we know it's too late now but do come back and allow our actions to make up for it. Allow us, to continue giving you all that you need as a consumer of tech.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Daniel Tsou<br />
