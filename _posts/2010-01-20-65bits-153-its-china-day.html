<p>I have no idea why is it called China day when it's not 1st Oct. But yes, China and Google are on the news almost everyday since last week when Google announced that their infrastructure has been under cyberattack from China. Germany Government advice their citizen to stop using IE until Microsoft release a patch. Google is going to place advertisement on the billboard found on Street View. And Lenovo releases non-black coloured Thinkpad. Don't complaint. Be glad that they haven't do pink yet. </p>
