<p><img id="image6" align="left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/se_z310i.jpg" alt="Sony Ericsson Z310i - SonyEricsson.com" />Sony Ericsson has just released the new Z310i, which is a budget version of the Z610i, which has attracted a lot of attention lately due to it's mirror-like shell's design. Being a budget phone, the Z310i does not do video calls, nor does it have an MP3 player like the Z610i. It comes with a 0.3 megapixel camera (you mean they still exist?!?), bluetooth, and an RSS reader (for you to subscribe to Tech65.org :P) and a photo blogging software that allows you to take pictures and upload them to your blog. No news about pricing or availability in Singapore yet, but expect it to be cheap.</p>
