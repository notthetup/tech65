<p>The Tech65 crew decided to push themselves to the limit by doing 65bits recording at midnight, right after attending 3 events back to back. This week, we discuss about the smartphone market share. No surprised that both Apple and Android are gaining market share. But Android is gaining more market share compared to Apple. This isn't surprising since most people are holding back for the next iPhone which was seen dropping at pubs over the world. (ok, maybe just US and Vietnam) Steam is now available for MacOS. Windows users has 1 less advantage over MacOS user. </p>
<p>And finally, HTC strikes back with 5 patent complaint against Apple. Get your popcorns ready. This is going to be an interesting show.</p>
