<p>Hello our little Minions,</p>
<p>We the lord-masters of Tech65 have noticed that there are two other compelling events happening on 29 March at what would be the same time as our Live Recording of Episode 65. In light of this startling revelation, we should've smote those who dare defy us but have decided in our magnanimity to forgive them their sin and move our 65th Episode to another glorious date: April 5 2008.</p>
<p>It may sadden you the piteous and yet hardy folk who listen to our show that we will however be skipping this week's podcast, and take a well earned rest, to recharge and savor the fruits of our labors. Also some of us will be attending the other events on the 29th, so expect us to grace you with our presences.</p>
<p>You, humble listener have no choice but to attend on the 5th of April, any excuses will not be tolerated and shall be dealt with with SlaveMaster Farinelli's Whip of Temerity, Point Guard Jerrick's Stiletto of Blind Justice, Flautist Daniel's Double Bass of Resonance, Defenestrator NTT's Ten Thousand Spikes of the Coconut Tree, and Getaway Car Driver Kai Yi's Old Laptop of Split Coffee.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, You are commanded to check out the alternate events on the 29th of March:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=11403512003">Social Media Breakfast: Singapore</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=10347735059">Web 2.0 - Emerging Industry Series</a></p>
