<p>Daniel and I were invited to a tour at the new Fujitsu Premium Care Centre two weeks ago. The new Fujitsu Care Centre is located at Funan DigitaLife Mall #04-38.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-492" title="dsc04477a" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc04477a.jpg" alt="dsc04477a" width="300" height="224" /></p>
<p>At first sight, the Fujitsu Premium Care Centre looks almost identical to most Care Centre in Singapore. Like most service centre, you bring your faulty device in, take a queue number and wait patiently for your turn. There is a couple of desktop for customers to access the internet, a corner where they showcase their newest product and some drinks. Everything looks the same, until you see this huge glass window with the technician behind repairing a laptop. Yes, that is most likely the guy who is repair your faulty laptop.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>It's an interesting concept that allows customers to witness how their device is being serviced behind a glass window. I don't know about others, but I always can't help wondering if the technician will take good care of my devices when I send them for repair. Yes, they should and they will. But having a glass window for you to see the technician at work gives you the confidence that your laptop will be will taken care of.</p>

<p>We had access to the technician work area to take a closer look at what happen behind the scene after the counter staff takes over your device. Everything is very systematic at the service centre. Every laptop in the work area is tagged with the technician's name for easy reference. There is a shelf for every stage in the repair process. From laptop on queue, waiting for parts, running diagnostic software and waiting for collection. Everything is organized in such a way that you can actually go in, point at any laptop and the technician can tell you straight away what they are doing with that laptop. And although its an "Open Repair Centre", security is still their main priority. All laptop waiting for collections are locked in the shelf that can only be accessed thru employee card. In short, your laptop is in safe hands from the moment the counter staff takes it from you till the technician returns it to you.</p>

<p>The thing that catches my attention the most is the Fujitsu iCare Notebook Disposal Service. The service centre also acts as a collection centre for customers to dispose their old Fujitsu notebook and battery. Fujitsu will send these devices to a specialised processing facility for proper disposal. We all know that we shouldn't throw battery into the dustbin. So if you have a old Fujitsu laptop or battery which you want to dispose, please send it to their service centre. I personally feel that all laptop manufacturers should do this too.</p>
<p>The Funan Fujitsu Care Centre is open daily from 10am to 7pm except on Wednesday where the operation hours is extended till 8pm to cater for the needs of working/schooling customers. Besides the Funan service centre, Fujitsu also has another service centre at 219 Henderson Road, #05-01.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sheena from The Right Spin and Keave from Fujitsu for the guided tour.</p>
