<p>Welcome to Tech65.org. Our flight time today will be 3.15 minutes and will take us through some seriously funny waters. This episode answers the perennial question of the traveller. What should I bring when I am travelling overseas? Jerrick returns with his slapstick brand of comedy to answer your questions. The laughs come quick and weirdly as Jerrick attempts to convey his message whilst covered in an airline's eyeshades. He also attempts to request copious amounts of alcohol from the non-existant flight attendants in his house. Nevertheless Jerrick does manage to bring some interesting advice to the table and we hope you'll enjoy this episode of Ask Jerrick.</p>
<p>Fly Safe and Bon Voyage,</p>
<p>Jerrick Lim</p>
