<p>Guess what guys? <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/03/debunk-really-bad-ipod-mockups-abound/">Engadget just debunked the iPod nano pictures</a> I linked to earlier. Apparently they were just mock-ups by some designer inventing his own Apple designs. Engadget even felt the mock-up was obvious, making me feel kinda stupid for actually thinking "it's a legit looking picture"... Looks like I've learnt to be a better tech journalist the hard way.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's just the Pre-5th Sept anxiety...</p>
