<p>Hello all! Welcome to the very first episode of 65 Bits, simultaneously done via Video and Audio! Thats right, you guys will get to see our ugly mugs! Lets see what we are talking about this week. Google Notebook and Firefox are updated. We talk about phones with HSDPA *Just sounds sexy don't it... HSDPA* so much that we forget to talk about the phones we wanted to talk about and thus decide to stuff it into the end of our podcast. We wax lyrical about HD-DVD and how Jerrick's got the deliciously Xboxy-lookin' HD-DVD drive. We discuss Command and Conquer 3 and its implications on our love lives. And lastly Happy Apple TV's been Hacked week y'all! Its an occasion to celebrate.</p>
<p>Your friend, online non-sexual love, confidant and close buddy that you don't know the last name to,<br />
JD</p>
