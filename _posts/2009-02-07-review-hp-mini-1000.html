<p>Without a doubt, the HP Mini 1000 at first glance, gives the sleek and cool looking net-book... the design on the cover has a subtle effect, and looking closely, one will realize the nice little patterns on the cover. :)</p>

<p><!--more-->It didn't help but oozes charm and class when you touch the edges of the HP MINI 1000... The sexy curves all around makes it really a charmer... boy, its a joy to carry it too... because it weighs in around 1 kg plus... making it light and easy to carry around.</p>

<p>This is how the back looks like. :)</p>
<p>The plus point is that it fits into my bags very well, and boots up, hooks to the wireless network in about 3 mins (cold-boot). It is simply great for doing work on the fly, and there is no need to worry about spending time to start the machine.</p>
<p>One thing that impresses me is the keyboard. At 92% of the standard keyboard, it makes typing a breeze, and it has a very lovely feel to these keys. :) I enjoyed typing some of my blog entries and email on it. :)</p>

<p>This is how the keyboard looks like.</p>
<p>A huge portion of the hinge houses the speakers. Built into that area, not only did it save space, but builds an element of class and elegance into the HP Mini 1000. The sound quality is great, and does not distort even when I am listening to tunes at its maximum volume.</p>
<p>Its a pity that the 3g slot feature is not activated for use in Singapore.   But I do hope to see it, and this will be the mobile warrior complete solution.</p>
<p>This picture summarizes the features of the HP Mini 1000 best...</p>

<p>Oh, did I mention that I still find the switch and the wireless button LED lights rather bright, and is quite a distraction when I use it in the dark :P</p>
<p>The memory card slot reader was another bugbear for me, because I extensively utilized the card reader to transfer my shots to the netbook. Because of the curves, its harder to feel for the slot, and one need to tilt the netbook to slot in the card, and vice versa to remove the SD card.</p>
<p>Despite those dislikes as mentioned above, overall, I find this HP Mini 1000 a perfect eye-candy netbook, that functions as good, or if not better than the rest of the netbooks available in the market. :)</p>
<p>Many thanks to Melvin, Waggener Edstrom, to review this lovely HP Mini 1000.</p>
