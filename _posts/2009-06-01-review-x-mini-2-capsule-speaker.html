<p>Got my hands on the lovely X-Mini 2 Capsule Speaker early last month to review. In fact, they passed me 5 speakers to test out. You might be wondering why did they pass me so many. Well, read on.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dk.sg/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc04643.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc04643-300x224.jpg" alt="dsc04643" title="dsc04643" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4560" /></a><br />
<strong>P.S. Don't forget to check out <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2009/04/23/gear65-18-x-mini-2-by-xm-i/">episode 18 of Gear65</a> where we took a look at the X-Mini 2!</strong><br />
<!--more--><br />
The X-Mini 2 Capsule Speaker is the 2nd generation of the award winning speaker that is designed in Singapore and made in China. Yes, you heard me right. This speaker is actually designed in Singapore. (Play patriotic songs) </p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dk.sg/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc04649.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc04649-300x224.jpg" alt="dsc04649" title="dsc04649" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4562" /></a></p>
<p>But do not be fool by the size. Although it is small, the sound quality and loudness produced by this speaker is amazing. OK, there is no way that I can demonstrate to you the quality of the speaker on this blog. Even our <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2009/04/23/gear65-18-x-mini-2-by-xm-i/">video review on Tech65</a> doesn't do the X-Mini 2 justices. You must listen to it yourself to really experience the quality. Or take my words for it.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dk.sg/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc04644.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc04644-300x224.jpg" alt="dsc04644" title="dsc04644" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4561" /></a></p>
<p>The X-Mini 2 is very portable. It is designed in such a way that you can "compress" the speaker when not in use to save space. The cables coils around the speakers nicely too. If you need longer cables, the X-Mini 2 comes with an extension. The X-Mini 2 has a built in battery which can last up to 11 hours. You can charge the speakers using the Mini-usb port. If you have been reading my reviews, you will notice that I love gadgets that make use of Mini-usb port. You don't need to worry about forgetting to bring the cables. Chances are, someone will have 1 in their bag.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.dk.sg/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/dsc04659.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dsc04659-300x224.jpg" alt="dsc04659" title="dsc04659" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4564" /></a></p>
<p>The best thing about the X-Mini 2 Capsule Speaker is that you can daisy chain the speakers together using their "Buddy Jack". There is almost no limit to the number of X-Mini 2 speakers you can daisy chain together. We tried daisy chain 5 together and it amazingly loud yet retains the sound quality. The PR company told us that they tried daisy chain up to 50 once and their neighbours lodge a police complain. Wahahahahaha. Note to all: Use the daisy chain system responsibly.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, I love the speaker a lot. One X-Mini 2 Capsule Speaker is already good enough for normal daily usage. But to really really feel the shiok-ness of this amazing speaker, you should try to get at least 2 of them and daisy chain it. You will surely wow your friends with it.</p>

<p>The X-Mini 2 Capsule Speakers is selling at S$49.90. There are other companies out there trying to imitate the X-Mini 2 design but honestly, the quality is nowhere near the orginal. So make sure you look out for the word "X-Mini" on the speaker.</p>
