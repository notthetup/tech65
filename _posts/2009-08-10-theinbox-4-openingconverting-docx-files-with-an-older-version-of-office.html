<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>"I need to open a .docx file but I don't have Office 2007, and I'm on a Mac. Is there a solution to this?"</p>
<p>- Gilbert</p>

<p><strong>The back story:</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft introduced the new "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML" target="_blank">Office Open XML</a>" file format with Office 2007 for Windows and Office 2008 for the Mac. A lot of people complain about it, but the Office Open XML file format (more commonly known as docx, xlsx and pptx files) actually allows Office files to be a lot more compatible with 3rd party applications since the file format is now open and easily accessible without proprietary code.</p>
<p>The thing is, not everyone has the latest version of Office, and not everyone is willing to pay a couple hundred dollars (in Singapore at least) to upgrade to the latest version when all they want to do is open these new files.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>:</p>
<p>The good news is that Microsoft has made available compatibility packs for Microsoft Office XP and above on Windows, and Microsoft Office v.X and Office 2004 for the Mac, and they're free!</p>
<p><strong>For Windows: </strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displayLang=en" target="_blank">Download the compatibility pack here</a>. Once you've installed the pack, you can now open the new files using Office. You can then "Save As" in your Office application to an older file format.</p>
<p><strong>For Mac: </strong><a href="http://http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.mspx?pid=Mactopia_AddTools&amp;fid=6B9238E1-CF69-48C4-BF2D-C4A8ACEEE520" target="_blank">Download the converter here</a> (Scroll all the way to the bottom of the page where there's a box that says "Details"). Once you've installed the application onto your Mac, simply look for "Office Open XML Converter" in the Applications folder to run the file converter.</p>
