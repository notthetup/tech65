<p>Planning to follow the Apple announcement happening this Thursday morning (Singapore time)? Why not do it with us? We're going to be hanging out at the video chat room located in <a href="http://www.tech65.org/live">www.Tech65.org/live</a> where you can join us as we follow the announcements. We believe that this event will make quite an impact in the technology space as we know it, so why not chat about it as it happens?</p>
<p>So join us from Thursday 2AM (Singapore time) and onwards (we'll start hanging around before that though) at <a href="http://www.tech65.org/live">http://www.tech65.org/live!</a></p>
