<p>Hey there. Farinelli here. So um, the hamsters did in fact revolt again, nearly destroyed the episode but my l33t skills saved it somehow, and I'm basically left to apologize for the volume issues in this episode. You do not want to know what happened while I was working on this episode. And even if you do want to know, I don't want to tell you. What I will tell you though, is that this week's episode focuses on the last, newest, and debatably the most promising of the big 4 smartphone OSs - <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Google</a> <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>. Zi Yong from <a href="http://www.codeandroid.org/">CodeAndroid</a> joins us in sharing with you the pros (what, what cons?) of the Android system - what it has brought to the table, what companies have done, and what will be done with it in the near future. Be sure to catch the next episode as we do a grand wrap-up of what we have discussed in the past four weeks. Guess who's back.</p>
<p>WANT TO FIGHT? WANT TO FIGHT?!</p>
<p>Daniel, DK, Fari, w/ Zi Yong</p>
