<p>It's a first look at the Nokia N97! One of the most highly anticipated phones in Nokia's line-up. DK and Hisham visit Nokia Singapore and brought back some HD video of this phone that's going to be on sale in Singapore in June 2009 by all 3 carriers.</p>
<p>How was it? In DK's words:</p>
<blockquote><p>The phone has amazing hardware and specs, but the software is just a normal Series60.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Hmmm... Like we said, it's just a first look. If we spend more time with it, perhaps we'll discover some of the changes in Series60 that could make it really powerful.</p>
