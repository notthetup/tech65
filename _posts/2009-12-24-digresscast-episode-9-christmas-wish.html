<p>Twas' the night before Christmas,<br />
And all around,<br />
the thinkeyly think, of Gadgety sounds,<br />
It was magical, it was fantastical,<br />
as the crew from 65, gathered round.</p>
<p>On the roof Nicole heard,<br />
the clompity compity of Saint Nick's reindeer,<br />
Daniel squealed, Fari grinned and DK had a beer,<br />
NTT played in the snow,<br />
as he is wont to do,<br />
whilst Justin, sweet Justin, roasted a cockatoo,<br />
Saint Nick showered upon them,<br />
a hard drive, a camera and maybe even a Voodoo or two!<br />
But alas this scene missed, a few boys, for they were up to no good<br />
Naveen with his wiley ways, and Jerrick with his bad taste.<br />
Saint Nick visited them anyway - to bring them a gift,<br />
one that lasts all time. The gift of friends, those who talk tech, and those who love tech.</p>
<p>As he parted, Ol' Nick said - Merry Christmas to All, and to All - A Tech Night :)</p>
<p>In this episode, we bring out our gadget geekness and discuss about what our dream gadget we want for Christmas. Weird ideas from controlling the weather, to teleportation, to brain dumps.</p>
<p>Happy Christmas, and May all your dreams be of Terabyte hard drives, DSLRs and well priced earphones.</p>
