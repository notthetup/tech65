<p>It turns out that the "Playstation Phone" everyone was looking for wasn't going to be a single phone strictly speaking, but a platform known as "Playstation Certified" that will be supported by several phones.</p>
<p>The Sony Ericsson Xperia Play that we are taking a first look at today is going to be the first "Playstation Certified" phone with a full game-pad and dual analog touchpads that provide enhanced gaming functionality to supported Android games, as well as the ability to play Playstation One games that have been specially ported over to this new platform! Not to mention that at the core, this device is still an Android 2.3 smartphone running on the new Xperia UI that we first saw on the Xperia Arc.</p>
<p>No news about release date or price just yet, except to expect it in the next two quarters or so.</p>
