<p>Yesterday was probably one of the biggest days in gaming this year. StarCraft 2 went on sale all over the world, and we were there at the launch event in Funan. What you might not know is how long the queues were! In typical Singaporean fashion, tons of people queued up for hours just to get their hands on a copy of StarCraft 2. We were also told that the first guy began queuing since 11am the day before! We don't know exact how many people were in the queue but I'm very sure there were at least a few thousand.  </p>
