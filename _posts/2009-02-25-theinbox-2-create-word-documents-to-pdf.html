<p>This question was posed to me by a friend over the phone (don't ask me for my number, that's a privilege for a select few ;-) ) while I was attending an event with other bloggers and press, and so I asked everyone present for a recommendation and they gladly contributed to the answer.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there a way to convert Word documents to a PDF document?</strong></p>
<p>A: There are many free solutions out there to convert not just Word documents, but any document to PDFs. <!--more--></p>
<p>If you're using windows, you can try <a href="http://www.pdf995.com" target="_blank">www.pdf995.com</a>* or <a href="http://www.doPDF.com" target="_blank">www.doPDF.com</a>. Both of these websites provide you with a free application that installs a virtual printer. All you have to do is to go to the document you wish to make a PDF out of, and print it as you normally would print a document. Except instead of the normal printer you usually print to, select the new PDF printer.</p>
<p>This means that you can convert practically anything into a PDF. As long as you can print it, you can convert it!</p>
<p>For Mac OS X users, the PDF printer is built into the Print dialog box. When you print a document, you can select the "PDF" button at the bottom left corner of the print dialog, and instead of printing the document on paper, you can create a PDF file right on the spot!</p>
