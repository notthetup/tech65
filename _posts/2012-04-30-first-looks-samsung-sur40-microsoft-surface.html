<p>Samsung has showcased the next generation of surface computing, the Samsung SUR40 for Microsoft Surface. Featuring PixelSense technology, this will be made available in Southeast Asia for the very first time, giving LCD panels the power to “see” and respond to touch and objects without the use of cameras.</p>
<p>Key highlights</p>
<p>·         Features a large, thin display that recognises fingers, hands and other objects placed on the screen – supporting up to 50 points of contact at one time<br />
·         40-inch Full HD 1080p (1920x1080) LCD LED panel combined with Gorilla protection glass for optimized screen durability and to protect from external shock and liquid ingress<br />
·         Offers a rich sound experience that can connect to a wide range of peripherals such as bar code scanners, cameras and printers through WiFi (802.11.n), Bluetooth or Ethernet connections</p>
<p>The Samsung-Microsoft collaboration is now available through the Samsung channel and reseller partners in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Pricing and availability may vary across countries and/or regions based on country-specific duties, taxes and fees.</p>
