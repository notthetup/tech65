It's always fun to talk about the future, especially since we're at the beginning of a new decade. Here's a chance for you to discuss what YOU think of the future, and win a HP Mini 5101 while you're at it.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>We've been talking about the future for quite a bit this month, from our presentation at HP's Future Is event:</p>

<p>One trend we've noticed is that the way we consume content is changing as we step into the future. Just this week, Apple launched the iPad, a brand new platform that claims to revolutionize the way we consume books, magazines and newspapers. Do you believe this is a direction we're heading towards?</p>
<p><strong>The contest</strong><em> (ends 28th February 2010)</em><br />
HP is going to give YOU, our reader, a chance to join in the discussion too! Here's the question that we want to put forth to you. How do you think we will use technology and consume content in the future? Leave a comment using your <strong>real email address</strong> (we promise we will not use it for anything save to let you know that you've won, of course!) here and don't stop the discussion!</p>
<p>As part of the the “<a href="http://futureishp.com/SGblogtrend.html">Blog a Trend</a>” contest by HP, HP will be selecting a blog that generates the best discussion, and the commenter with the most thought provoking comment from that best discussion gets to win a <a href="http://www.gdgt.com/hp/mini/5101" target="_blank">HP Mini 5101</a> (worth S$799)!</p>
<p><strong>So once again, here's our question to you:</strong></p>
<h3>How do you think we will use technology and consume content in the future?</h3>
<p><strong>Note: this contest is only open to Singapore Residents (Many Apologies to our International Readers)</strong></p>
