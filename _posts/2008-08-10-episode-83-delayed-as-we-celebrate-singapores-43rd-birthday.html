<p>Hey everyone!<br />
Just wanted to inform you guys that episode 83 of 65bits will be delayed due to Singapore's National Day celebrations that happened this weekend. Don't worry though, as episode 83 will still be out this week, albeit a few days later than usual. Expect lots of stories this week!</p>
<p>So on behalf of the Tech65 crew, have a wonderful National Day! Happy birthday, Singapore!</p>
<p>Daniel Tsou</p>
