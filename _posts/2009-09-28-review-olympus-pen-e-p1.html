<p>The Pen E-P1 is the latest camera to be heralded from <a href="http://asia.olympus-imaging.com/products/dslr/special/pen50th/pen/" target="_blank">Olympus</a>, sporting the microfourthirds format, which gives SLR quality performance, in terms of photographic quality, even in low lighting conditions.</p>
<p>Olympus created the Pen to go without mirrors and non-reflex lens; two components which are the hallmarks of the SLR cameras, film &amp; digital, without sacrificing much of the handling and versatility, users have come to expect from any companies claiming the SLR compliance.</p>

<p>The E-P1 follows the design blueprint of the Olympus Pen F series; featuring a corrugated plastic grip and an overall metallic design which harkens one to the days of yore. For Singapore consumers, it is available in three basic offerings as follows;</p>

<p>A lot of reviews have been given to the Pen E-P1 series; while I am very sure they are pleased with it, I have to caution users who have been told that it has a similar quality to an SLR camera, to be wary before making their purchase. This is not to take away users from purchasing the Pen E-P1, having used it myself, I find that the pictures it captures are worthy mentions in any digital competitions. The Pen E-P1, suffers slightly where user handling is concerned.</p>
<p>Here comes my disclaimer. When it comes to using a camera, I am at ease, when using compact cameras like the Canon Ixus or Sony T90 series, also the camera functionality that comes in most mobile phones like the Nokia N78 and on towards the slightly bigger Canon Powershot &amp; Nikon Coolpix, and further on towards the SLR cameras, the Canon 300V, the Nikon d90, the Sony Alpha series etc.</p>
<p>In comes the Olympus E-P1. By virtue of its photographic quality, it should hang out with the SLR big boys; whereas its compact size makes it the brethren of the compact cameras. However, thats where the similarity ends. The Pen feels heavy on the hand when you expect it to be light; making it difficult for a one-handed operation, more commonly done on the compact camera. The weight distribution also seems unbalanced, especially when you use the 14-42mm lens. With an SLR camera, it is immediately clear on how to handle it, whereas things get a little shifty and iffy with the Pen. If you have purchased this camera, it will be good to note that, with constant use, you will definitely get the hang of it.</p>

<p>Handling issues aside, I am very pleased with the performance of the Pen. Having been testing it out for a couple of weeks thanks to the kind folks at <a href="www.august.com.sg" target="_blank">Augus</a>t, I am able to check out the various features that came with the Pen. The pin-hole function is a personal favourite; it gives the quality, reminiscent of pin-hole boxes, without taking away the clarity one would expect from this genius of a camera.</p>
<p>If you are in the market for a new camera, with stylish design in mind, powerful features and pleasing result, the Olympus Pen E-P1, is without a doubt the one you can list down as a To-Buy.</p>
<p>I will end this review with a short video introducing the Olympus Pen E-P1 to the world.<br />
