<p>SHAMELESS PLUG: The HUNDREDTH episode is coming next week. 27th December 2008 @ 1400. Be there. Or be octagonal.</p>
<p>Whooda' Thunk it. We'd be reunited as one at the open doors of the home, the crib, the HQ of Tech65. At Jerrick's home where his mother's recent return has meant a nicely cleaned home and nicely chilled cola. In the spirit of openness we're glad to see that many more companies have joined Google's Open Handset Alliance. We look at various speed limits that graphics card companies and solid state memory companies try to break and also wish a very happy 40th to the mouse. Now don't you think it's time you stepped down and let some fresh faced junior take over?</p>
<p>Listen to Me! You have No Time! The 100th. It's COMING!<br />
Left Hand of Destruction, Red Ring of Death, Black Knight of Insolence, Pink Tunic of Destiny.</p>
