<p>Tech65 crew was invited to the January 2012 product launch of Samsung mobile products. The reason we are being specific on dates is because Samsung have a lot of product range so we will have to specify this Interview is refering to which product launch.</p>
<p>For today's event(4th January 2012), Samsung Asia Pte Ltd announced the launch of the following mobile devices.</p>
<p>· GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus<br />
· GALAXY Tab 7.7<br />
· GALAXY Nexus<br />
· GALAXY W<br />
· Omnia W</p>
<p>Product specifics was not covered for this interview as we try to understand the marketing strategy for Samsung Asia Pte Ltd in Singapore as well as the expected roll-out of LTE-enabled devices for Singapore. In Singapore, 2 out 3 main carriers have rolled out LTE networks and consumers are definitely eager to use their mobile devices at higher speeds.</p>
