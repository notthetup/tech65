<p>In a battle that would've impressed the best Hollywood directors, Tech65 HQ broke out into a scramble that quickly escalated into a battle of Epic proportions. Tables were set alight, chairs thrown, bananas eaten and jam jars broken. The only casualties in the entire scene however were all the monkeys hired to replace Tech65 journalists, Hisham, Nicole, NTT, Jerrick, Farinelli etc. The bodies of these simians were carried out in the late night to be dumped quietly in the ocean after frantic negotiations with the authorities managed to keep the entire affair on the DL. All this over a softcore pornographic picture and two bottles of Red Bull. It goes to show that when you want something done right, hire human.<br />

Daniel Tsou, Editor in Chief of Tech65 had to begin negotiations for a new set of contracts, re-signing his old colleagues. It was not easy, and took the better part of 20 minutes, but a new agreement was reached. Nicole would be receiving more attention from her male colleages, and a nice gift once in a while. Jerrick would be allowed to get away with devoting an episode or two to baking and the gadgets required to make a perfect cake. NTT was to be given a free blond dye job at a salon of his choosing, and some well priced coffee beans, Farinelli will be getting a lifetime supply of anti-depressants and haircare products... the list goes on.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Tech65 will be reconstituted in the way it was, with a crew as devoted as before to seeking the truth and finding the awesome tech that you want and need. :) Thanks for the support guys and We love you.</p>
<p>HAPPY APRIL FOOLS :D</p>
<p>For those of you out there who really believed. Thank you. And We're sorry. We understand we've come to be a part of your Tech news life and we hope you will take this joke in the spirit it was intended. We still love you...</p>
