<p>Another one of those delayed posting. The hamster is still trying to catch up with those production. Anyway, on that interesting week, the crew discuss about the HP Print Apps and ePrint which was announced in Hong Kong. Google is rumored to release a social networking site to rival Facebook. Well, its still rumor but we are praying hard that it's for real. .xxx top level domain is finally accepted by ICANN and everyone is talking about it.</p>
<p>Did anyone notice that ICANN also approved Chinese alphabet domain name? Hmmm...... not many. So this one is for the 1.33 Billion people out there. </p>
