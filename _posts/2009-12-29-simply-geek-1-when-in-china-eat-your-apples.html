<p>Hello World!! This is the 1st official episode of Simply Geek, our brand new podcast on Tech65. The idea behind this podcast is to allow the crew to talk about Geeky topics (not just Tech) of their own interest. It could be new ideas, discussions, opinions and most importantly, topics that interest us. So each host (and maybe guests) brings to the table, one topic which he/she is responsible for leading and the rest is well, simply geek. Of course, we end off each week topics with sidetrack, because that's what Tech65 does best, where we just talk about random geeky things (something we've gotten good at, so we thought we'd just make it a segment :P). </p>
<p>Oh and did we mention we record this show over Skype? Yes indeed. Mainly because we're all located all over the world. And, another cool 1st is our theme music for this podcast. We decided to rope in some help from our creative friends and got <a href="http://myrightbrain.wordpress.com/">Ivan Chew</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/ramblinglibrarian">@ramblinglibrarian</a>) to help us with the music. Pretty cool huh?</p>
<p>So, we really hope you enjoy our new show. And please do give us feedback about the idea, content and execution of Simply Geek. You can email us at sg {at} tech65.org. Or any one of us individually.</p>
