<p>DK and I were at Dell's launch event on Monday where they were showing off both new computers as well as computers from their existing line-up. One of them was the Adamo XPS, a machine that has been on sale for a bit, but has always been behind a glass display at Dell's retail shops here in Singapore. We finally got a chance to go hands on with this very uniquely designed machine.</p>
