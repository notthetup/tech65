<p>One thing most Sony products that comes to me have in common is that I'm always excited to receive them. This time it's no different. It's the Sony Vaio X! It's the thinnest notebook (by estimation, not scientific measurement) we've gotten to date!! You can tell how excited I was to get it! A pity that our review unit didn't come with the extended battery, which was said to be packaged with every unit.</p>
