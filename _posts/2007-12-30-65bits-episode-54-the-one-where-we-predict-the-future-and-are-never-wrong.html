<p>This episode, where we look back on a fruitful and eventful 2007, we reflect, ruminate, and eventually drink lots of coffee. We're proven wrong, we're proven right, we make fun of each other, we drink more coffee. But more importantly we make new predictions, ones that will NOT be wrong. NO, We're RIGHT! *Ed: Calm Down, Calm Down, don't make me Tase you, Bro* These predictions may sound overly general sometimes, but we're just covering our bottoms. We also talk about the stuff we want *GT-R, 135i, a couple of Gallardos*, and Yes, they are decidedly Technolicious.</p>
<p>Its been a great 2007, but 2008 is looking to top even that!</p>
<p>Happy New Year,<br />
The Tall, The Goateed, The Calm, The Musically Inclined</p>
