<p>Today's episode is the longest one ever, we ramble, we quibble, we talk and we bore. Weeellll, we hope you won't be bored with this week's fine selection of interesting snippets. We talk about Windows Vista and rant about all stuffs DRM. And we talk about tech flying high, and the biggest mobile exhibition in Barcelona in brief and also Windows Mobile 6. Intel plans on running Graphzilla outta business. Thanks for your patience, and we still love y'all don't worry!</p>
<p>With just a hint of regret,<br />
Dan and Jer.</p>
