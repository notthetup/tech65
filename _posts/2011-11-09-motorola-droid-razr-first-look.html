<p>Justin got a hands on with the the newest Motorola anDROID phone, the DROID RAZR. The DROID RAZR sports a dual 1.2GHz TI OMAP4430 processor, driving a 4.3-inch 960x540 qHD Super AMOLED Advanced panel. The screen is covered by a Gorilla glass, support on the back by a KEVLAR sheet for added strength. There's 1GB RAM on board. The rear video camera does a 1080p video, while the front facing 1.3MP camera can be used for video conferencing.</p>
<p>The RAZR will run the Android 2.3.5 (Gingerbread) but will get the Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) upgrade when it comes out later this year. On the software side, it had something called Smart Actions. Similar to Tasks, Smart Actions lets you choose a set of rules that automatically trigger particular actions attached to those triggers. It also has new service called MOTOCast which allows you to stream and share media from your desktops/laptops into your RAZR.</p>
