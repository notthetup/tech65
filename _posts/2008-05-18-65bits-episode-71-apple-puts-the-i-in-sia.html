<p>In this week's sum up of the eternal chess game between Microsoft and Apple, Microsoft is definitely overwhelmed with only the king, queen, two bishops, and a castle left, surrounded by just about the entire back row of Apple's white pieces. Apple's cornered the royal couple, but Microsoft turned the tables... well turned the stool around by moving the bishops smack in front, segregating the XP market from the Vista market. Fantastic move in delaying Apple's deadly advances. In addition one of Apple's pawns seem to have gone off his route, possibly dropping valuable hints on the successor<strong>s</strong> of Apple's queen. Both castles advancing at full speed ahead with confirmations of the iPhone in Asia in H2. Black-square knight is still negotiating with Singapore's favorite Big Fat Green carrier, so the BFG says. White-square knight made a surprise hard right putting Apple's eternal I into Singapore's favorite kebaya-clad carrier (nobles only please).</p>
<p>To find out what the hell all of that meant, listen to this week's episode of 65bits, brought to you by our enthusiastic listeners. Yup, including you.</p>
<p>Daniel the King, Jerrick the Queen, and Farinelli the Black-square PR Bishop</p>
