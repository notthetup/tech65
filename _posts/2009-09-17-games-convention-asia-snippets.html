Held at Suntec City Convention Centre, it is also the host of Asia's largest e-gaming tournament which includes the Starhub Cup &amp; the One Asia Cup.</p>
<p>The Public Exhibition is found at Hall 401, Level 4. It runs from today (17th September 2009) to Sunday.</p>
<ul></ul>
<p>The local polytechnics and the SAE Institute have also put up booths for their game &amp; animation development programmes. It is interesting to see them engage at a level beyond the boundaries of the lecture theatres.</p>
<p>I feel that Tech65 readers would be interested to know that on the 19th September, there will be a designated "Students Day" where several key industry leaders speak about the topics closer to their heart. Some of the speakers include, Takahiro Murakami - Lead Producer EA Japan, Olivier de Rotalier - Ubisoft Singapore &amp; Tad Leckman - Lucasfilm.  There will also be a discussion about "Breaking into the Games Industry", moderated by Allan Simonsen. The panelists will be Tad Leckman &amp; Olivier de Rotalier.</p>
<blockquote><p>Update 1345hrs: There is an announcement from MagmaStudios - who will be developing a new virtual world - where an ancient kingdom ruled the island &amp; men-eating tigers roam all over. The project is supported by the National Heritage Board(NHB), the multi-agency Interactive Digital Media R&amp;D Programme Office (IDMPO) &amp; hosted by the Media Development Authority of Singapore(IDA).</p>
<p>Titled World of Temasek, it recreate Singapore, immersing viewers into the city walls of Bukit Larangan(present day Fort Canning) &amp; the moat surrounding its palaces and temples. Viewers reprise various roles, exploring Bukit Larangan and the Singapore River MMOG (massively multiplayer online game) style. MagmaStudios promises deep &amp; rich education content with the element of fun thrown in. There wil be a learning opportunity where players engage in spices trade &amp; other goods, collect virtual artefacts while learning more about the particular artefacts from the NHB museums' collections.</p>
<p>The technology used for World of Temasek is called MagmaFlow, which is a quest-building toolkit for virtual worlds. It promises engagement similar to the social media engagements seen today, promising future upgrades by virtue of its modular nature.</p></blockquote>
