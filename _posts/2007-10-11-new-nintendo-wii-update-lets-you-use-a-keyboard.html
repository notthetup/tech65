<p>Just this morning, my Wii received a message informing me that there's a few new updates. The new updates actually FINALLY give you the ability to hook up a USB keyboard to input text anywhere in the Wii!</p>
<p>There are actually 3 updates to do.</p>
<ol>
<li>Nintendo Wii System Update 3.1 (visit the wii system settings and find the system update button)</li>
<li>Internet Channel (Go to the wii shop then the wii wares and find the internet channel to update the channel)</li>
<li>Everybody votes (Go to the wii shop then the wii wares and find the internet channel to update the channel)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not sure what other updates are in the wii, but this is the most obvious for now. I hooked up my own keyboard and it works great! You can use your keyboard any time there's a text input. However, you will still have to go into the text input screen first. At least it's a start!</p>
<p>Oh, and Singapore's WiiConnect24 server is still not up yet, so don't change your country to Singapore yet.</p>
