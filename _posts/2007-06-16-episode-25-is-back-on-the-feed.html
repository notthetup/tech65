<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>I just returned from camp to discover that Episode 25 was left out from the feed. That means that those of you who subscribed to the show probably didn't get Episode 25. We've fixed the problem already, and it's back up. We apologize for the inconvienience. Thank you for your understanding, and we hope you enjoy the episode!</p>
<p>Daniel</p>
