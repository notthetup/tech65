<p>We finally got our hands on the X-Mini Max II, the highly anticipated stereo capsule speakers by Singaporean company XM-I. These stereo speakers are based on the X-Mini II that we reviewed a while back, and they certainly sound like X-Mini IIs, except being stereo speakers they bring a better dimension to the music you play on them.</p>
<p>Of course, like the X-Mini II, we've done an unboxing video the moment we got the unit. Stay tuned for Gear65's full X-Mini Max II review!</p>
<p><b>UPDATE 27th October 2009:</b> The guys at XM-I have gotten back to me and informed me that the package I got is not the final version although the speaker is. They are aware that the case in the packaging you see in the video where I have trouble fitting the speakers into was the wrong case, and assured me that they are rectifying the issue as far as the final retail package is concerned.</p>
<p>In any case (no pun intended), I think it's a small issue, since you're buying it for the speakers, which have served us well during <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2009/10/27/singapores-unofficial-windows-7-social-party-a-report/">the Windows 7 Social Party</a>.</p>
