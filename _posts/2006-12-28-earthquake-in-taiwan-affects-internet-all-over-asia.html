<p>A 7.1 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Taiwan on Tuesday damaged undersea fibre-optic cables, causing the internet in Asia to be drastically affected. ISPs have rerouted internet access to go around the affected regions, but internet access is still slower than usual. It may take a few weeks before we're back at full capacity.</p>
<p>Miraculously, Tech65.org is still working fine. So you can still get your dose of weekly podcasts as we follow updates regarding this "virtual black-out".</p>
