<p>The Nikon 1 V1 and Nikon J1 are Nikon's late entry into the mirrorless interchangesable lens (MIL) arena. As with other cameras in the MIL genre, the aim is to provide the image quality and lens-changing flexibility of DSLRs in a compact form factor.</p>
<p>The V1 and the J1 accomplishes both. Image quality is better than compacts and comparable with entry-level DSLRs, while the camera body remains compact.</p>
<p>It's a good choice for those who want to leave the shooting to the camera in Auto mode most of the time. The Motion Snapshot and Smart Photo Selector features are pretty nifty. My personal favourite is the slow motion video,</p>
<p>Those who prefer manual mode may find it inconvenient to get at the manual modes and some of the settings such as ISo and White Balance - as this can only be done via the screen menu.</p>
<p>Feedback on the settings is also not immediate as you vary the settings(you have to press the OK button to update the preview based on the setting).</p>
