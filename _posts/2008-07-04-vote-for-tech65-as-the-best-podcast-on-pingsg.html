<p><a href="http://ping.sg/awards#cat5" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/awards-5.png" alt="Best Audio/Video Podcast" border="0" /><br />Vote Me</a></p>
<p>We actually had no idea until recently that we've been nominated as the top 5 podcast on the singapore blog aggregator <a href="http://www.ping.sg">Ping.sg</a>! So help vote for us! We're known as "Tech65 by 65bits" (I know it's reversed, but we never expected to do more than 65bits when we first joined Ping.sg...) in <a href="http://ping.sg/awards#cat5">the nomination page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your support and your votes!!</p>
<p>Daniel Tsou</p>
