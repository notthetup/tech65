<p>We must have been very excited today, because we spoke so fast. That's probably because we finally have not 1, not 2, but 3 hosts today! This week the XBox 360 seems to be moving on quickly, while there are more reasons why you shouldn't get a PS3. Or you could just switch to PC gaming, since Nvidia is pushing out stuff too. In other news, the Apple TV is out, and like every other Apple product, we want one. We know you'll send us one, right Apple? Then we discuss the question that keeps us awake at night: can you build a PC for less than S$1000?</p>
