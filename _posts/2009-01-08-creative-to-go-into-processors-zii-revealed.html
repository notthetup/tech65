<p>Creative has finally revealed what they are up to with Zii.com through a press release just an hour ago. Apparently they're getting into making processors.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-323" title="Creative Zii chip" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/creativezii.jpg" alt="Creative Zii chip" /></p>
<p>Read on for the official press release.</p>
<p><strong>Update: The Zii.com website is not up yet. I'm guessing it will be up by tomorrow morning</strong></p>
<p><!--more-->Creative Forms ZiiLABS and Ushers in the Era of StemCell Computing™ Where<br />
Nano-Sized Super Computing Will Be Available in Our Daily Lives through<br />
Flexible, Tiny, Powerful and Scalable SoC</p>
<p>SINGAPORE – 8 January 2009 – Creative Technology Ltd. today announced the formation of<br />
ZiiLABS (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative), with the combination of 3DLABS — which<br />
has a 25-year history as a leading innovator in programmable graphics, media and applications<br />
processing — and resources drawn from the largest product group in Creative, the Personal<br />
Digital Entertainment group.</p>
<p>The formation of ZiiLABS, the launch of the new ZiiLABS ZMS-05 SoC (System-On-Chip) and<br />
the new Zii™ Platform today usher in the new era of StemCell Computing™. The new ZiiLABS<br />
ZMS-05 SoC (System-On-Chip) will be unveiled and demonstrated from 8-11 January 2009 at<br />
the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in the Creative exhibit #30651 in the South Hall of<br />
the Las Vegas Convention Center.</p>
<p>“We have invested a billion dollars and 10,000 man years of R&amp;D effort over the last 25 years in<br />
platform solutions,” said Sim Wong Hoo, Chairman and CEO of Creative Technology Ltd. “The<br />
combination of the technology from 3DLABS and the product development prowess of our<br />
Personal Digital Entertainment group delivers a complete, powerful and energy efficient<br />
platform with a very rapid time-to-market for our partners – the Zii Platform.”</p>
<p>“We now look to shaping the future of computing with the introduction of the integrated ZMS-<br />
05 media-rich processor, and ushering in the new era of StemCell Computing where we will<br />
bring the incredible benefits of nano-sized super computing right into our daily lives,” said Hock<br />
Leow, President of ZiiLABS.</p>
<p>This StemCell approach has benefits in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li> Flexibility — Utilising a breakthrough technology comprising of programmable Processing Elements (PEs) which are basically Software Defined Silicon</li>
<li> Scalability — 10Gigaflops to Petaflops (1015 floating point operation per second)</li>
<li> Energy Efficiency — Huge processing power of the ZMS-05 SoC enables it to perform more in less time, equating to low power consumption</li>
<li> Complete Solution — Ready-for-Market Zii Platform Solutions Unlimited Flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Stem cells are the basic building blocks of life, possessing the unique ability to develop into the<br />
specialised cells and tissues required by organisms to function effectively. Inspired by this<br />
concept, the ZMS architecture uses an array of media-optimised Processing Elements (PE) as its<br />
stem cells that can instantly develop into any of the specialised acceleration functions required of<br />
today’s media rich devices and offering advantages in terms of flexibility, performance and<br />
features when compared to the fixed function silicon blocks traditionally used in SoC designs.<br />
Incredible Scalability</p>
<p>The scalability of the ZMS architecture is highlighted in the first Teraflop Accelerator with the<br />
footprint of an A4-sized sheet of paper, consuming less power than a desktop PC. By utilising<br />
the virtually unlimited chaining capability of the ZMS chips, a state-of-the- art ‘hypercomputer’<br />
with many Petaflops of processing power can be realised, which can be 100 times smaller, 100<br />
times greener and 100 times lower cost than conventional super computers.</p>
<p>High Energy Efficiency</p>
<p>Due to the compute density of each Processing Element, the ZMS-05 SoC is able to do an<br />
immense amount of media processing in far less time — and with far less energy — than taken<br />
by standard processors; which translates into longer battery life. Intelligent power control means<br />
the speed and power consumption of the processor can be matched to the task in hand and<br />
unused features can be turned off completely, put in deep stand-by and reactivated instantly after<br />
weeks of shut down, helping to lengthen battery life even further.</p>
<p>Complete Zii Platform Solutions</p>
<p>The ZMS-05 processor combines the media processing array, dual ARM cores and a rich set of<br />
integrated peripheral controllers with hardware platforms and advanced SDK and middleware.<br />
This will enable Software Developers, OEMs, ODMs and System Integrators to create unlimited<br />
possibilities and develop a broad range of highly innovative products.</p>
<p>ZiiLABS Launch Partners</p>
<p>With the excitement about the ZiiLABS platform now public and the ZMS-05 in production, the<br />
Company is pleased to be working with many OEM partners worldwide announcing products<br />
based on ZMS including: MicroStar International, Perception digital, F&amp;S Electronic, MediaNet,<br />
ASTAK, PowerLinux and Grandeye.</p>
