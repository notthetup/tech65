<p>The skies gave little confidence to our intrepid crew as they set off for the haven. A haven of good coffee and tantalising treats known as <a href="http://www.geekterminal.com/">Geek Terminal</a>. They arrived to find themselves surrounded by a sea of their friends, lovers, exes and future flames. It was a beautiful sight. Our crew launched into learned discussion, of things Apple, and of the accuracy of the words we've already said. We also make a prediction as to the sort of goodies that will be bestowed upon us by good ol' Santy Claus. Eventually, <a href="http://jerricklim.com/?p=429">cake</a> was unleashed on the crowd, and <a href="http://blog.dk.sg/">DK</a> broke down and flew. High. As a kite in the sky.</p>
