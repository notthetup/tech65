<p>Welcome to our first edition of Snap65! When it comes to cameras, there aren't many variations to the user experience. Therefore, instead of showing you the same thing over and over again on Gear65, we decided to show you the thing that matters to you most in your camera purchase: the photo quality. And what better way to do it than in a PhotoStory.</p>
<p>In this first edition, we take a look at the Nikon Coolpix S6300, a point and shoot camera.</p>
<p>Hope this PhotoStory was useful to you! Since this is our first attempt, your feedback is extremely valuable to us. Tell us what you liked or didn't like in this story, and what we should have tested but didn't, as well as suggestions on how we can improve the tests. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>- Daniel</p>
