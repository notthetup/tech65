<p>This article appeared on Digg today. It's a very legit looking picture of what seems to be the next iPod nano to be announced this thursday morning. We talked about such an iPod (i.e. the form factor) a while back in Episode <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2007/08/26/episode-36-somewhere-to-govern/">36</a> of 65 bits and how it doesn't really make sense, but now that I saw this photo, it makes more sense to me. It matches the user interface that was leaked (check out episode <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2007/07/30/episode-32-apple-microsoft/">32</a>)</p>
<p>For fear of possible take-down notices, <a href="http://www.gearlive.com/news/article/q307-leaked-images-of-new-3rd-gen-ipod-nano/">I'm just going to link to the story</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
