<p>Tech65 has Phoebe from Edelman, DK from Blog2U, and Sabrina helping Gavin from Fleishman &amp; Hillard to thank, for inviting us to the Samsung AV Roadshow 2008 (and Mobile too, although that was discussed last episode), GT/CISCO collaboration press event, and the ultra-glam Scarlet event respectively. In this very berry extremely zomgwtfbbqkthxbye special episode, Farinelli, Daniel and NTT talk about what went on in these three events.</p>
<p>In the interest of keeping this episode from being an uber-dull run through of every darn item and its specs, we have skimmed through them to bring you the various products' one outstanding feature. Should you wish to find out more about any product mentioned in this episode, please email farinelli[at]tech65[.]org and he will be glad to try to answer your question(s) with as much information as the press kits provide.</p>
