<p>The gadget to be reviewed this time... its the Motorola Razr2 V9 phone. Thanks Johahn from Fleishman Hilliard for the loan of a beautiful phone! :)</p>
<p>The V9 comes in 3 colors, Rose Gold, Mahogany, and Black.</p>

<p>First impressions, sleek, pretty, and definitely and eye-candy. Coupled with a nice shiny finishing, it has definitely enhance the glam factor of the phone. Though that means attracting fingerprints, but it is not as bad as I thought. One part of the external LCD is touch sensitive, thus expect loads more of prints on the screen itself.</p>

<p>Being a clam shell phone, one would wonder if it will be very bulky, but this phone is so thin that I could hardly feel a thing in my pockets. It hardly forms a bulge in the pockets, and sits snugly, in position. The hinge feels sturdy and thats a good thing to know :P</p>

<p>This is how it looks like when I flip the phone open. :)</p>

<p>The keypad feels flat, yet its responsive to the fingertips, and allows me to type fairly quickly, and the directional keys are a hit, allowing ease of navigation throughout the phone. The screen is large enough for one to view all the contents at one go. Graphics display are sharp and vibrant.</p>

<p>I like the icons, makes it very easy for one to view, and the re-ordering of icons option makes it all the more easier to customize to my preferred layout in the menu itself.</p>
<p>This phone is very suitable for camwhore enthusiasts... because one can snap pictures of oneself very easily via the external LCD screen, which doubles up as a viewfinder and mirror to check on your appearance.</p>

<p>Its a handy feature! :)</p>
<p>The external LCD also doubles up as a SMS reader (reading incoming sms), browsing call history, as well as to play music, images and even videos. Nifty feature I would reckon, for I need not flip open the phone.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NRQEjJ8VtM3_aPi_DtFO4g?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CIMG0136.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The internal LCD provided a clear and crisp viewfinder to snap pictures. And I would have to say that the quality of the photos is quite decent. :)</p>
<p>The call quality of the phone is clear and sharp, and the sms interface is easy to use. Not to mention that the pre-installed games on the phone kept me entertained for quite a while on the move, bowling and suduku (pretty addictive).</p>
<p>The browser was decent, and allowed me to surf to plurk, twitter effortlessly, though I disabled the loading of images and sounds, so as not to eat up too much of my gprs data. (I don't have a data plan, so it can be quite ouch at the moment).</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Motorola Razr2 V9 phone uses a Mini-SD card, as a source of external memory to store all that music, photos, videos etc.</p>
<p>Overall, the metallic gold adds to the glam factor of the sleek clam shell phone. The key pad and the screen is a hit with my mum, as she says it makes it easier for her to see :P The friendly user-interface is a hit, and the OS is more stable compared to the previous Motorola Phone that I had, the Moto Rokr E1.</p>
