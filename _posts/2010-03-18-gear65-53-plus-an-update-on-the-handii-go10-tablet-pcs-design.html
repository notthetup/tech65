<p>It turns out that Handii had made a mistake and gave us a pre-production unit of the Handii Go10 Tablet PC featured in <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2010/03/11/gear65-53-handii-go10-tablet-pc/">last week's Gear65</a>. The retail unit that was on sale at the IT Show last weekend was a lot more polished and clean. Handii sent us a retail unit so that we can correct the mistake, so here it is!</p>
<p>The retail unit only fixes the paint job on the device though. The limitations to the user experience is still there, though we've been told that they have some newer models with a built-in keyboard that could potentially make up for some of these limitations. We'll certainly keep a look out on what Handii has in store for the admittedly crowded Tablet PC market.</p>
