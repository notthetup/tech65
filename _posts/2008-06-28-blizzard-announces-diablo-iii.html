<p>I'm actually surprised no one has noticed this yet. Blizzard unveiled Diablo III today at the Blizzard Entertainment Worldwide Invitational. I could dig up all the new features of Diablo III and tell them to you, but where's the fun in that? </p>
<p><a href="http://www.blizzard.com/diablo3/index.xml" target="_blank">Here's the link to the Official Diablo 3 website to discover for yourself</a></p>
<p>And here's a summary of the new game:</p>
<blockquote><p>Twenty years have passed since the cataclysmic events of DiabloÂ® II. Mephisto, Diablo, and Baal have been defeated, but the Worldstone, which once shielded the world of Sanctuary from the forces of both the High Heavens and the Burning Hells, has been destroyed, and evil once again stirs in Tristram....</p></blockquote>
<p>Jerrick and NTT will definitely have lots to say about this new game on Episode 78 of 65bits... ;)</p>
