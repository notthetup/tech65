<p>Today (19th September 2010) is the last day of Panasonic at Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza, where they showcase how tough is their toughbook.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="432" caption="Panasonic Toughbook Road Show"]<a href="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs634.snc4/59466_431450386482_619411482_5289054_6713403_n.jpg"><img class=" " title="Panasonic Toughbook" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/59466_431450386482_619411482_5289054_6713403_n.jpg" alt="Panasonic Toughbook Road Show" width="432" height="288" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>It is really appreciative for Mariam to tour us around on a Saturday afternoon even though it is not her working day. Thank you Mariam.</p>
<p>Whenever people wanted to have a durable notebook, someone will always suggest toughbook. Personally, I do know that toughbook is durable and it is until I come to this road show it amazes with my eyes.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>We have heard about splash proof and waterproof notebook, and down here is it 100% water resistance. One station with constant water flowing on the notebook and Mariam is still able to type and under this condition.</p>

<p>Another station where Justin Lee actually stands on top of toughbook and even tried stamping it. Pretty tough huh.</p>

<p>What’s more, he even throw the toughbook a couple of times from chest level at different angles. Needless to say, the toughbook still works well.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="288" caption="Throwing"]<a href="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs322.ash2/60226_431450221482_619411482_5289041_4920595_n.jpg"><img class=" " title="Throwing" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/60226_431450221482_619411482_5289041_4920595_n.jpg" alt="Throwing" width="288" height="432" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>As we knows electronics sometimes breakdown when there is a extreme change in temperature.  We were told that toughbook is able to work under extreme weather from -20 degrees to 70 degrees.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="432" caption="Temperature Test"]<a href="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs306.ash2/58633_431450271482_619411482_5289047_6767793_n.jpg"><img class=" " title="Temperature Test" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/58633_431450271482_619411482_5289047_6767793_n.jpg" alt="Temperature Test" width="432" height="288" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Of course, this is the rugged series of toughbook. There are different series for different purpose.  Like this clinic toughbook for healthcare solutions like hospital and business toughbook for people like me who might damage my notebook accidentally sometimes. The business toughbook which particularly interest me is the battery life and weight. It can runs up to 8 hours of power on time, perhaps 6 to 7 hours of working time for me. Even though with such long battery life, what impress me is that this business toughbook weigh only 1.26kg and with a DVD super multi drive.</p>

<p>With all the upside on toughbook, Tech65 is not biases about Panasonic, we also share with you the downside.</p>
<p>A couple of us feel that the circular touchpad is perhaps a little small and awkward and the outlook is slightly thicker than other notebook.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="432" caption="Toughbook CF-W8"]<a href="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs650.snc4/61026_431450241482_619411482_5289043_7091787_n.jpg"><img class=" " title="Toughbook CF-W8" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/61026_431450241482_619411482_5289043_7091787_n.jpg" alt="Toughbook CF-W8" width="432" height="288" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>With normal usage, the toughbook really stands out for its durability. However, for techies who require more RAM like 8GB or 16GB, you might need to request for tailor made toughbook to suit your taste. Yes, toughbook can be tailor made. The usual RAM is about 4GB.</p>
