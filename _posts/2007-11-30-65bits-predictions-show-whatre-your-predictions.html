<p>Salut, Mon Petit Enfants!</p>
<p>The end of the year is peering over our shoulders, and you know we're getting ready to get Fari good and drunk. But outside of our merriment inducement, we are asking YOU to predict what technology's going to bring in 2008. Take this chance to get your 3.142 seconds of fame on Tech65's podcast, if we really like you, we might actually give you 15 seconds. </p>
<p>All you need to send flying at our heads are the audio recordings of your predictions in the following format.</p>
<p>1. Name/Nickname<br />
2. Shameless Plugs<br />
3. Predictions for 2008</p>
<p>We do respectfully ask you to keep everything short and sweet (30s).</p>
<p>Gaze deeply into your crystal balls, psychically transmit it to us, as mp3s at <strong>predictions [at] tech65.org</strong> with the subject "65Bits Predictions for 2008".</p>
<p>To record your own voice, you can use a mic and a software like <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>, or <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">Garageband</a>. Or, you can come to our 50th Episode recording tomorrow and we can record your predictions live!</p>
