<p>Jerrick is transformed into the God of Fortune, just for Chinese new year! It's his 24th year and through some miraculous Dragon Year transformation as decreed by the Goddess of Food, Drink, and Committee Meetings, Jerrick is now the God of Fortune! And he's even wearing a special festive red! So now that you've done the rounds and eaten your fill and opened your Red Packets... what will you do with all that cash lying around in near 2s 5s and 10s? Let Jerrick help! With the help of his silent sidekick, chilling in the back and playing on the Alienware, Jerrick will tell you what's good for this Chinese New Year.</p>
<div></div>
<div>Happy New Year from all of us here at Tech65!</div>
