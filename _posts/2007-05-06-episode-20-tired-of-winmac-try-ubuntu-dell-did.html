<p>Jerrick decides that he has had too much of the US of A and flew back just so that he could be with you kiddies. We see several breakthroughs this week, Creative releases the Zen Stone, ok... so maybe not a BREAKTHROUGH. Dell takes advice from their customers, HD-DVD and Blu-Ray issues again. We see people Wiiing all over Singapore, Microsoft betas Longhorn Server, and shrinks Xbox 360 chips in the Fall of 07, making one editor particularly cheesed off. We also mention future theoretical plans for a platform from Intel, Aka Chipzilla.</p>
<p>Run Away!!!<br />
Its Jerrick and Daniel!</p>
