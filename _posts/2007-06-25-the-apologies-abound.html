<p>One thousand Apologies, and then some to all you loyal listeners out there. Our podcast this week has been delayed due to unforseen technical difficulties as we were trying out a new recording device for our podcast. Please be patient and our dear readers you will get your just rewards soon.</p>
<p>With love and kindness,<br />
Daniela, Jorick, NTeeTee</p>
