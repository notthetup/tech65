<p>So Apple launched a bunch of brand new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook">Macbook</a>s and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro">Macbook Pro</a>s early this morning (Singapore time). I'm not going to talk about them because I'm saving all that for this Saturday's 65bits with the crew. However, I <em>have</em> to talk to all of you who have been complaining about Apple removing that button from the track pad. Seriously, before you start ranting, make sure you dig up the facts first!!</p>
<p><em>Note, this isn't a "Woot! I love Apple!" post, it's a "What are you guys talking about!?!" post.</em></p>
<p><!--more--><br />
<strong>The button is STILL THERE</strong><br />
First of all, there is a button. THE WHOLE TRACK PAD has become a button. And I'm not talking about the touch thing that you find in all of today's laptops (i.e. if you tap on the track pad, it's a click). I'm talking about a physical "push-and-the-track-pad-sinks-in" button. In fact, according to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/14/apple-macbook-aluminum-and-glass-super-shiny-hands-on/">Engadget</a>, if you're used to pushing that button at the bottom of the track pad, it shouldn't feel any different. It's one of those "it's there, you just don't see it" things.</p>
<blockquote><p>We actually don't hate the all-clicking trackpad much at all. (If your thumb muscle memory makes you click at the bottom where the button used to be, it works and feels pretty much the same.)<br />
- <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/14/apple-macbook-aluminum-and-glass-super-shiny-hands-on/">Engadget</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>In fact, now you have more!</strong><br />
Here's a fact that many people missed out. There's actually preferences that allow you to set "multiple buttons". That means you can set regions on your track pad to be buttons, like the Mighty Mouse. In other words, you can set the bottom right of the track pad to be "right-click", and when you click (as in really push that corner of the glass down) that region of the track pad, it will right click! So not only did they not remove any button, they added an extra one!</p>
<blockquote><p>If youâ€™re coming from a right-click world, you can right-click with two fingers <strong>or configure a right-click area on the trackpad.</strong><br />

<p><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/multi-track-multi-button.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/multi-track-multi-button.jpg" alt="See? Multi-Button via software! It&#039;s from Apple&#039;s keynote!!" title="Multi-Button via software" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-251" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>You can get multi-buttons via software, so if you're a Windows user coming from Windows and you'd like that right-click button, no problem, just turn it on in Preference and you got it.<br />
- Steve Jobs, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=275834665">Apple Keynote</a> (21:36)</p></blockquote>
<p>His Steveness only mentioned it once, and didn't show it off. He should have, because this is a pretty useful feature! How do I know? Because everyone is complaining that it's not available! This is better than having a right-click button!!</p>
<p><strong>So what does all this mean?</strong><br />
This new glass track pad has the best of both worlds! It allows you to have any kind of button you want, including a PHYSICAL right-click button (c'mon, you have to admit it's about time, right?), yet still increases the track-pad's area by 37%! Only Apple can pull that off! So now can you stop complaining about the new track pad? I can't believe I have to do all the work for you... Apple, you owe me one.</p>
