<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We're hitting the BIG 5-O next saturday, and we'd like to ask our listners, all three of you out there, (we know you're there, we can see into your homes) to join us for our recording session on Saturday 1st of Dec at Geek Terminal. All the relevant details are at the end of this post.</p>
<p>We'll be having a live recording, and YOU can chip in as well, with your thoughts and ideas about the topics of the day. We'll be publishing the list of topics on Friday, so you can get a chance to read the stories before you come down, and shout out loud like the barbeque lovers that you are.</p>
<p>After a splendiferous podcast, we invite all our buds who came down to sit down and geek out with us, (it's like hanging out only we put the word geek into it to make it sound cool), and of course savour the delicious coffee provided by Geek Terminal. You are also encouraged to bring your own laptop so that you can soak up the complete Tech65 Package.</p>
<p>Oh, and did we mention there will be a cake baked by the rather tall one.</p>
<p>So, do come down and join us, and if you can't, don't worry, we will be livecasting the recording and the geek-out session on <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/65bits-episode-50">ustream.tv</a>. Tune in to the tech65 channel on ustream.tv and don't forget to shoutout, rant, post, pontificate, salivate on the tech65 shoutbox on <a href="http://www.tech65.org">our website</a>.</p>
<p>Be there, for we know where you live, and we will hunt you down and drag you here...</p>
<p><strong>Date : Saturday, 1st of December, 2007<br />
