<p>Now that DK is back from reservist, finally, and I'm off duty from producing 65bits, we're back again with the next episode of DigressCast. This DigressCast Episode is a little special. To make up for the loss of episodes while DK was on reservist, we did 3 episodes of DigressCast almost back to back. Alright then, without letting you wait further, our latest digression. Seriously, I have no idea how to write any show notes because we kept jumping from topics to topics and back again.</p>
<p>So sit back, and enjoy.</p>
<p>DK, Justin</p>
