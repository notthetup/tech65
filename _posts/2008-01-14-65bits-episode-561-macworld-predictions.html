<p>Bless this Macworld, for we are unworthy of the bountiful fruits it may bring, You can almost smell it coming, and as San Francisco, the world, and the one and only Steve Jobs prepares for Macworld '08, we prepare in our own small simple, occasionally convoluted, always funny, generally interesting way by throwing some iPredictions onto the iAltar of that which his Steveness will announce to those unMac-ed masses, those poor saps who are un-iPoded, un-iMaced and unReady for the deliciousness that is to come.</p>
<p>Are uReady? iAm.</p>
<p>iCame, iSaw, iPoded<br />
iDan, iRick, iRinelli, iYi</p>
