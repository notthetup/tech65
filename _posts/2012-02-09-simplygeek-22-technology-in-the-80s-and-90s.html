<p>On this episode of SimplyGeek we go down the memory lane, to talk about how technology was in the 80s and the 90s. We talk with stalwarts of technology field who have been through the 80s and 90s being geeks themselves and continue being involved in technology today. The stories and the analogs of technology in the 80s and 90s are fascinating reminders of where technology came from and where it is today. We geek out on everything from calculators to disk drives the size of washing machines.</p>
