<p>At at least half the width and height of most notable <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/best-ipod-speakers/">premium iPod speakers</a>, the <a href="http://sg.store.creative.com/products/product.aspx?catid=4&amp;pid=19181&amp;utm_source=sg.creative.com&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_content=HomepageMHL_ZiiSoundD5&amp;utm_campaign=ProductAd_Speakers">Creative ZiiSound D5</a> is a physical dwarf among it's peers, and quite possibly a welcome one. Where the key turns the lock though, you would think one purchases speakers with sound quality as their primary factor (although there's always that small group of people who seem to enjoy proving us sensible people wrong. Let's not go there today). Is it possible that Creative pulls an X-mini and delivers sound far beyond its size?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-905" title="ZiiSound-D5_610x458" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ZiiSound-D5_610x458-300x225.jpg" alt="ZiiSound-D5_610x458" width="300" height="225" /></p>

<p>The thing one should understand about Creative speakers, if you haven't already, is that they love to color their sound heavily. For those lost in Jargon-land, it means that the speaker produces a sound different from what the signal is supposed to be. Granted, no speaker in the world is able to produce tit-for-tat what the audio signal feeds it, but in Creative's case, they color their speakers to produce quite a characteristic Creative sound - unbelievably thick and rich midtones, highs that aren't piercing even at louder partying volumes, and a discreet yet firm and distinct bass.</p>
<p>At this point, I should clarify that I am sensitive to higher frequencies, so if you have a more "accurate" or bass-inclined ear, you may find the D5 (well, most Creative speakers in general) too muddy for your liking.</p>
<p>Because of its relatively shallow form factor, the D5's bass lacks the all-important <em>oomph</em> when projecting distinct bass beats, especially kick-drums. The speaker has an air-vent at the rear, another of Creative's characteristics, and while such limited space can only move so much air, it is more than enough to fill the lower mids and higher basses (contra basses or electric basses) with spirit and body, creating a solid foundation to its music.</p>
<p>While it is hard to relate the idea of speed to audio output, some speakers (and/or circuits) are not well-constructed enough to handle complex or fast music properly, giving rise to the notion of it being "slow" and being unable to keep up with the music it is supposed to be projecting. As should be expected of any premium audio product, the D5 handles such situations with ease, and a full 50-member orchestra, 40-strong chorus, and legendary soprano, all at full volume, soars through the speaker, united yet almost individually distinguishable. Because of its nature as a long block of wood, stereo separation is severely limited, but the sheer definition of every instrument or voice present might just be able to make up for that.</p>
<p>Presumably because of the aforementioned coloring, vocals seem to tend to be thrown to the forefront of your listening experience. You can almost feel the singer being separated from the band and brought forward to sing in front of your nose. And while we are still on these two topics, the D5 certainly can handle most musical genres above market expectations, but its sound signature seems particularly inclined towards the classical, vocal, acoustic, pop, and rock genres. Heavier metal styles (anything with harder distortion than Linkin Park) lose out because the musical depth and weight of higher distortion levels are all but lost in the lack of a proper bass system. The more extreme high frequencies produced by sitar string whines or sliding across guitar strings are still, as said, well-defined without becoming painfully shrill, and adds a great depth to one's music. Most excitingly and importantly for me, the D5 picks up on the sighs of piano sustain pedals, which for some reason audiophiles (including me) lust for, along with lever clicks and bow scratches. The downside of all this wonderful sensitivity is that for older recordings, especially those recorded and engineered on tapes, hiss is very easily picked up. Still, that shouldn't be too much of a problem, since these inadvertent productions aren't so loud that they distract the listener from their beloved music.</p>

<p>Along with the very convenient and detachable Bluetooth transmitter, the apt-X codec makes it possible to not only play music via Bluetooth, but high fidelity music, and even games on your iDevice, since transmitting lag time is drastically reduced to a barely noticeable lag.</p>
<p>Creative is asking SGD399 for this baby, and that is in the lower range of the prices of premium stereo iPod sound systems, but hefty nevertheless. Is it worth the burn on your pocket? If you aren't fussy about bass, or are searching for a more compact speaker, this may well be the product for you. If you are an audiophile however looking to hear music the way the sound engineer meant it to be heard, you should stay away from this, and I daresay just about the whole Creative lineup. You get great music from this nifty device, but what you are definitely not getting is audiophile-grade accuracy.</p>
