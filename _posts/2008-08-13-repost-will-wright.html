<p>Taken from <a href="http://jerricklim.com">Jerrick's Website</a></p>
<p>There’s a very good chance that I will meet Will Wright, Creator of The Sims, Sim City and Spore, on Friday. Have you any questions for the man himself? Ask them here and I will forward them on!</p>
<p>And NO I can’t ask him to crap out a copy of Spore for you.</p>
<p>-EDIT- Sorry. I didn't get to see Will Wright! He had to leave early because he was tired. He had been in Singapore for a week doing the publicity for Spore. Ah well. Some other time then eh?</p>
