<p>This is the 1st episode of our brand new DigressCast. We have hinted *subtly* on twitter, 65bits, and most followers should know that this is finally here. There is no script. There is no topic. We just talk about anything we want. However, we are still feeling our way through what DigressCast is, and how it should be like. Right now, it's really to hear us talk crap and digress.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Enjoy our new output for Digression.</p>
<p>DK, Justin</p>
