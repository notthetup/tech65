<p>Apple has just dropped the price to the 1 gb iPod shuffle and subsequently introduced a new 2gb version of their clip on player. The 1gb player is now US$49 while the 2gb version takes the previous US$79 price. </p>
<p>Edit: The news is out that the 1gb iPod Shuffle has had its price reduced to S$78. Very nice. The 2gb version's price has not been announced, but we can guess it'll be S$138 like the previous 1 giger. This provides a really affordable option for those seeking a jogging iPod, or such like.</p>
