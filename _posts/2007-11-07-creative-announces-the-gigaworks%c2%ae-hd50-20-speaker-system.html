In summary that hardly justifies these babies, we were impressed and we were disappointed. Suffice for now to say that if you are a casual listener looking for a more immersive audio experience, this is <strong>the speaker system</strong> for you this year-end. We have much more coming about how we feel and what we like and don't like with the full detailed video review over at Channel 65 <em>reeeaaaalll</em> soon, so stay tuned! Meanwhile, facts about and features of these speakers and corresponding pics.<br />

<p></a>The one thing about the GigaWorks family of speakers that hits you first, if not immediately, is that all of them have powerful tweeters, with ringing (and thrilling) audio reproduction. In the same vein the one thing about the HD50 that you notice right away is that you never would have thought that speakers of that size and build, only 14.1cm tall, could ever be capable of grabbing hold of you like it does with its range and richness. Fun fact while we're at it: these speakers are also carefully angled at 10<font size="4">°</font> to project the outgoing sound right into your appreciative face.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gigaworks-hd50-basxport-01.jpg" title="Bass Port"></a><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gigaworks-hd50-basxport-01.jpg" title="Bass Port"></a><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gigaworks-hd50-basxport-01.jpg" title="Bass Port"></a></p>

<p>The HD50 is a cumulation of several technologies. The BasXPort technology basically puts an air shaft in the speaker with a flared end (like a brass instrument) at the top to throw out and project <a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gigaworks-hd50-he-driver.jpg" title="Creative High Definition Driver"></a>low (aka bass) frequencies right up at you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gigaworks-hd50-he-driver.jpg" title="Creative High Definition Driver"></a><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gigaworks-hd50-he-driver.jpg" title="Creative High Definition Driver"></a><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gigaworks-hd50-he-driver.jpg" title="Creative High Definition Driver"></a><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gigaworks-hd50-he-driver.jpg" title="Creative High Definition Driver"></a><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gigaworks-hd50-he-driver.jpg" title="Creative High Definition Driver"></a><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gigaworks-hd50-he-driver.jpg" title="Creative High Definition Driver"></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gigaworks-hd50-he-driver.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Creative High Definition Driver" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/gigaworks-hd50-basxport-01.jpg" title="Bass Port"></a>This leads to the second feature - the high definition audio drivers (CHDD). 2" in diameter, the catch about this set-up is increased <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excursion_%28audio%29">excursion</a>. What's excursion? Simply put, how much space the diaphragm has to vibrate back and forth. With increased excursion, the driver can produce more powerful bass previously un-producable, if you will, in speakers of this size. Couple this with BasXPort, and the deal is done. Or is it...?</p>
<p></a><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hd50-titaniumsupertweeter.jpg" title="Supertweeter"></a><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hd50-titaniumsupertweeter.jpg" title="Supertweeter"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/hd50-titaniumsupertweeter.jpg" title="Supertweeter"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hd50-titaniumsupertweeter.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Supertweeter" /></a></p>
<p>On the other hand the supertweeter projects frequencies up to 40kHz. What for, when humans hear only up to 20kHz (and we know that many already have trouble hearing 17kHz)? Because, according to them, we can still <em>perceive</em> these ultrahigh frequencies even if we cannot detect them aurally. And this brings soothing and transient aural appreciation to us.</p>

<p></a></p>
<p align="left">Finally, the HD50 uses dedicated amplifiers, one for the bass/mid CHDD and one for the supertweeter, instead of the more conventional single amplifier piping to two drivers. In the second setup, when there is a need for more bass, the woofer or low-frequency driver draws more power from the amp, and eats into the energy meant for the tweeter. In this new setup however, each driver draws its own power and <em>can draw its own power without doing so at the expense of the other driver</em>, which probably explains the presence of a power supply adapter as part of the package for such a small speaker system.</p>

<p align="left">Why choose 2.0 speakers when you can have yourself a dedicated bass speaker? Well apparently you're missing out on some major mid-range frequencies when you use 2.1 speakers. The reproduction work is split between the satellite speakers and the subwoofer, and both of them tend to take extreme ends of the audio spectrum, leaving the mids out. 2.0 speakers on the other hand handle all three frequencies, ensuring more accurate and warmer audio reproduction. However, and here's a taste of how I feel, it's more a question of what you wish to sacrifice. Warm mids that can wrap themselves around you and suck you into a world of musical enjoyment, or thumping bass to give that extra kick and groove?</p>
