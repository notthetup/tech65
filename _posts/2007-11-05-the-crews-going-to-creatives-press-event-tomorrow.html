<p>Farinelli and I have been invited to the Creative HQ to attend a press event tomorrow where they will be launching a new product. My guess is that it's probably a speaker system.</p>
<p>The invite reads "Something small is going to blow you away. Creative invites you to experience the power of our miniature Towers of Power. You are advised to bring along a G-suit or safety harness."</p>
<p>I'm thinking of live blogging the event. Maybe through twitter? We'll see.</p>
