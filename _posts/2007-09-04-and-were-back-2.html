<p>In case you didn't notice, Tech65 went down for an upgrade earlier. We've upgraded from version 2.1 to version 2.2.2 of Wordpress. Not that you'll notice any difference, but I think it's good to stay updated. We don't do it very often because there are always risks involved when there's an upgrade, so don't worry, it happens only every few months that you won't notice it. :)</p>
<p>Anyway, for those of you who have been affected, thanks for your patience!</p>
<p>Daniel</p>
