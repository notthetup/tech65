<p>We are doing our recording at secret location #462. This week, the crew talk about the upcoming Google Editions, which is E-book on the web browser. Although most of the Tech65 crew aren't avid book readers, we are pretty excited about the news. Especially the model of having E-books on a web browser, which essentially means that you can bring your E-books almost everywhere. Including the iPhone/iPad and Apple can't do anything about it. Unlike Flash which Apple said will not be coming to iPhone and iPad. But Adobe did show off their Flash running smoothly on an Android device. </p>
<p>And speaking of tablets, the Apple iPad will be coming to Singapore in July. No details on the exact date, time and location yet. But keep following Tech65 and we will update you once we got the news. </p>
