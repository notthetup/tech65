<p>My dear Listeners,</p>
<p>It pains us to say that we are not going to post this week's podcast on the site. Reasons are threefold. First, our computer that we use to upload the podcast, is broken officially. And we didn't get a chance to upload it when we wanted to during the weekend due to a bad connection. But here's a summary of this week's podcast.</p>
<p>The main points this week include, the upgrading of Buzz pods in Singapore to feature Wi-Fi, and Internet Access kiosks by PacNet as well. Creative's Zen Stone which we roundly dissed when it came out has a successor already, and this is what the Zen Stone should have been in the first place. Double the memory of the shuffle, a screen, FM radio, voice recorder and still very much cheaper than a Shuffle! Truly a good proposition for those who haven't jumped on the iTunes bandwagon. We also talk about some cameras that we may never see in Singapore by the wonderful company of HP. They all look really good and would probably make a good budget proposition. Check it out on the HP site. We also see the emergence of new Youtube features, some of which truly amazing, such a the ability to edit your movies online, a mobile portal *something we will see more of in the iPhone* and the establishment of International sites.</p>
<p>In PSP news, a new firmware update has allowed for the running of the PSP at full speed, *333mhz for those curious people* however this means lower battery life but more frames, and I've read that the first game to take advantage of this speedbump would be God Of War.</p>
<p>And lastly we talk about the iPhone and see a future for it in Singapore. A future in 2008 with possible 3G. This panel of editors also are worried at the implications of the virtual keyboard and are most concerned about the price and how it would affect its uptake in Singapore. It would seem that we're a bunch of iPhone pessimists but actually we are truly truly amazed by the sheer integration that has been achieved with the iPhone and the connectivity that it would offer. This would be the first phone ever to truly truly be able to achieve the coveted status of Well Executed Converged Device for any strata of Society.</p>
<p>Much Love,<br />
Jack Daniels and No Touchy Touchy.</p>
