<p>Apple has just launched the 32GB iPod Touch, which is on sale now on the Apple Singapore online store. Unlike what they usually do with previous lines of iPods, they did not eliminate the 8GB and drop the price of the 16GB. Instead, they simply added the new model to the line up.</p>
<p>The price of the 32GB model is S$848 and it will ship in 1-2 business days (that means earliest next Tuesday, thanks to the long weekend starting today). If you need a refresh of the other models, the 16GB is S$698 while the 8GB is S$498. Are you going to pay that much just to have that touch interface? Until Apple announces support for the 3rd party applications for the iPod Touch, it's really just not worth it.</p>
