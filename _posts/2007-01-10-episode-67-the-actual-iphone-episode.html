<p>This episode we wax lyrical about the iPhone, and unfortunately or typically, or even classically, or better yet as is customary for any piece of new technology, come to a conclusion that is wholly unsatisfactory. We are pleased with the work that Apple has put out, and Daniel has abandoned his Wii fantasies *doesn't that just sound deliciously dirty* and moved on to the iPhone... We also mention other MacWorld finds. This episode comes to you courtesy of the good people at Skype! Our first call-in episode!</p>
<p>With a tinge of doubt that sends guilt through our Apple loving heinies, Jamilla and Daniella (Alter Drag Queen Egos of Jerrick And Daniel)</p>
<p>P.S. Yes we're straight, and Yes Daniel's all Man, much like Daniel Craig... Jerrick's All Man and then some;)</p>
