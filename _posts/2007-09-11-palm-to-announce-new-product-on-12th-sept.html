<p>What's with companies and Wednesdays this month? Anyway, Palm's <a href="http://euro.palm.com/europe/en/thenewsmartphone">gonna announce a new product</a>. It's not the Foleo, as you would have known from last week's 65bits. <a href="http://blog.palm.com/palm/2007/09/its-a-bird-its-.html">It's not the Centro</a> (this rumoured smartphone) neither. Could this new product bring Palm back to it's days of glory?</p>
<p>What do you think it could be? What do you want from Palm? Or what do you think they need to bring them back?</p>
