<p>What a way to start a Monday morning!</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/triplez82">Justin</a> and I went up to Fusionopolis to meet Chris Whitney, the CTO OF HP Singapore and the managing director of <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/singapore/">HP Labs Singapore</a>, as we chatted with him all about his venture into technological innovations. Chris spoke to us about his childhood foray into technology right up to the point where he became a founding director of HP Labs in Singapore that <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/about/">focusses</a> on cloud computing, mobile and immersive experiences among many others.</p>

<p>What struck me the most was how Chris was still very focussed on the human interaction element of every day life and using technology as an enabler and tool! Let's hear from him as we chatted on that monday morning :)</p>
