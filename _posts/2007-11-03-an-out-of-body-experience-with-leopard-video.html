That's us playing with the new Photobooth on Mac OS X Leopard using the Holographic effect that we "modded" in.</p>
<p>So here's the background:</p>
<p>So Farinelli and I were over at Jerrick's place checking out Mac OS X Leopard and the first app we played with was Photobooth. One thing that I was upset about in the new Photobooth was that they took out the Star Wars holographic effect!! That's like THE effect all geeks want!</p>
<p>But have no fear! I found a story on MacRumors about a guy who made his own version of it, so I helped jerrick set it up, and here it is! While playing with it, we discovered a bug that caused our picture to be stuck inside, so we decided to play with that bug, and that's how we did it!</p>
<p>Oh, and do try out the user-made plugin to make holographic effects in Photobooth for Mac OS X 10.5!</p>
