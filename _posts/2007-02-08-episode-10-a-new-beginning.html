<p>A New Beginning for Cheng Wei our new host on Tech65, he's alittle muffled sounding this ep because of technical issues. Jerrick however is in his usual loud and proud glory. Jevvick has vinstalled vindows vista, another new beginning for him too, and he's mildly in love with it. We talk about Pocket PCs and the old school Psions. Shuffleies are out in multi-coloured glory. We want a Pink one, and a Blue one, in support of people who no fashion sense.</p>
<p>Thats all for today babes,<br />
Your friendly neighbourhood hot men,</p>
<p>That cool guy, Jerrick and That soft broody guy, Cheng Wei.</p>
