<p>This week's episode brought to you by EasySafe, Win a copy of Easysafe with a comment in our post!</p>
<p>This week's episode with only two men and no booze, comes with much news, such as that of Microsoft losing interest in its hot fling, Yahoo. Expensive and yet totally desirable tech from Lenovo, HTC and Apple shows up on our desks and we cannot help but drool all over our keyboards. We are also in awe of Robots and Local researchers that bring us good tidings. Tis a great time to be alive, and geeking out before we die of too much American junk food.</p>
<p>We Love YOU GTAIV,<br />
Niko Bellic and Roman Bellic.</p>
