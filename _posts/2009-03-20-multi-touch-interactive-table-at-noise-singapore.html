<p>I was invited to the launch of <a href="http://noisesingapore.com/">Noise Singapore</a> at Far East Plaza Level 1 a few weeks ago. Initially I thought it's just going to be an Arts event. I didn't expect to see any high tech stuff at the event. Well, I was wrong. There is this amazing Multi-touch interactive table that was created by a local company called Digital Dreams Pte Ltd. The event organizers are using the Multi-touch table to display some of the artworks by local young artist. Check out the video I took.</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/qmvPajT5jOY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qmvPajT5jOY&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>From what I understand, the software is running on top of Windows XP. It has a 42 inch touch screen but they can support bigger screen if you want. Pretty cool stuff. Looks like we are another step closer to minority report.</p>
<p>Check out the Multi-Touch Interactive Table in action at Far East Plaza Level 1 from now till 29 March 09.</p>
