<p><strong>Update: This was our 2009 April Fools joke</strong></p>
<p>It is truly unfortunate, but Tech65 has had a minor set back in terms of our staffing situation. Following the economic downturn, many of our writers have had to take on second and third jobs in order to continue contributing on a pro-bono basis to Tech65. Unfortunately, this has lead to a slip in the quality and the quantity of stories provided by our organisation.<br />
<!--more--><br />
As such, we have decided that starting 1st April 2009, Tech65 will have a whole new organisational structure. We will be hiring a new CEO, whose name shall remain undisclosed but I will say has had a stellar career running an IT services firm specializing in providing internet out of the many Pacific Islands. He has also had a long and illustrious career working at Del Monte, in particular the division handling the banana plantations. We are proud to have such a man on board our new team.</p>
<p>We will also be hiring a whole new team of editors to cope with the resignations of several of our writers. These include the top writers from all industries. From National Geographic, we have the top monkey photographers, and to as part of our coverage of Panasonic's latest line of Toughbook computers, we've hired the same team that came up with the monkey in those ads to head up our editing. Rest assured that they will be working with no breaks for any kind for fruit or leaves, and certainly we've cancelled all peanut bonuses in line with the Obama administration's call to cut costs.</p>
<p>We assure our audience that there will be NO banana peel style slip in the quality of the programming coming from our pages. You will be able to swing from page to page, and listen in on the vine that will bring you the best in Singapore's tech programming.</p>
