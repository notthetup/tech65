<p>This particular episode we record at Suntec's famed Sky Garden to the wonderful strains of wind blowing and leaves rustling and well, it could be worse. The Tech65 technical staff is fully aware of the problems and of course we will try and get something done, but of course resources are a Major problem and well here goes. This week, we see an incredible resurgence from Palm from of all places, spy photos, and we hope and pray that these are a real Palm product in the future, New Macbook Pros make a splash with their new graphics, new screen, and Centrino Pro, we discuss the various vagaries of the tech world today including Solid State Drives, job cards, virtual keyboards and more! Last on our show today is a quick discussion of a new car that changes the way we look at small engined turbocharged cars! The Volks Golf GT.</p>
