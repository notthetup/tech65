<p>We did this episode when we're really high on caffeine. This is the first time where we have most of the Tech65 crew gathered together after doing so many episodes of 65bits and Gear65 at one go. This is our usual DigressCast style format where we just talk about anything under the sun. But there's something special about this. We have a timer called Farinelli to buzz us when the topic becomes stale and moving to the next topic. Interesting? Let us know.</p>
<p>Enjoy the episode!</p>
