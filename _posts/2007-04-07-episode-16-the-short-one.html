<p>This episode is, as the title of the Episode implies, a short one. This was done intentionally to become more Youtube friendly. In this episode, we talk about the emergence of Old Retro phones, that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. We speculate on the true existence of the Wii, and if its all just not a big joke played on Singaporeans. Asus makes it actually possible to play a high end computer game on your Laptop! Apple shows that its the king of Cores for good reason, afterall what's an Apple without its Core, and the new Mac pro's definately got that... 8 of that. And lastly we speculate on the future of DRM, and consult the all knowing Oracle, and she said, puffing on her cigarette, saying, Yes, its the beginning, of the end.</p>
<p>The Ones, Daniel &amp; Jerrick</p>
