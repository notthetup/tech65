<p>HP continues its spate of announcements with more thin and light notebooks, both dubbed the Ultrabook and alternatively the Sleekbook. These models are available in the Ultrabook flavor with Intel's chips. And at the same time, HP has introduced their AMD stablemates, the Sleekbook as they utilise a set of processors from AMD. These notebooks utilise discrete-class graphics chips that are integrated into the CPU. Very interesting as this offers consumers much more choice as to the kit that they would like their thin and light notebooks to be fitted with.</p>
