<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CommunicAsia 2012, together with BroadcastAsia and EnterpriseIT was officially opened yesterday by the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim.</p>
<p>In his opening address, he touched on several topics, the island-wide switch to ultra high speed Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network, or Next Gen NBN, the development of the data.gov.sg portal which provides more than 7,000 government datasets for public usage, the nationwide switch to digital TV broadcasting, the auction of the 4G spectrum and have drawn out plans to construct a Data Centre Park.</p>
<p>IT spending in Singapore have been predicted to grow 5.5 percent year-on-year in 2012, driven by the innovative use of ICT, adoption of mobile devices and services and increased demand for ubiquitous and high-speed connectivity. The Next Gen NBN have seen more than 12 service providers differentiating themselves by packaging their ultra-high speed broadband plans with value added services. As for data.gov.sg, there have been development of more than 60 apps using the data sets, including augmented reality-based park navigation guides for users to find direction to amenities within public parks.</p>
<p>The Media Development Authority, or MDA, had last year, conducted a successful digital broadcast trial using the latest Digital Video Broadcasting - Second Generation standard, or DVB-T2 standard. Dr Yaacob announced that Singapore's free-to-air TV channels will go fully digital by the end of 2013 using the DVB-T2 standard. Singapore will complete the switchover from analogue to digital broadcasting by 2020, in line with ASEAN's agreed timeframe for making the switch.</p>
<p>The Information Development Authority, or IDA, allowed Singapore mobile operators to deploy 4G services using their existing spectrum and have sought views to allocate a total of 320 megahertz of spectrum for 4G services. Once this framework is finalised, IDA intends to conduct a 4G spectrum auction by 2013.</p>
<p>The propose Data Centre Park plans to attract world-class Internet and media companies to host their content and services in Singapore. The Park will be a specialised industrial park for data centres, supportive of the setting up of premium Data Centres.</p>
<p>CommunicAsia2012 will run from the 19th to 22nd June 2012, from 1030am to 6pm (1030am to 4pm on 22nd June 2012) at Marina Bay Sands B2, Levels 1, 4 &amp; 5. BroadCastAsia will be located Suntec City Convention Centre.</p>
