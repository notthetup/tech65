<p>This week, Love is in the air, with the bounties that the various tech leviathans have bestowed upon us: Videos on Flickr, Google's app engine for FREE computing, The amazing little beauty that is HP's Mini-Note, and of course more iPhone rumours. We also shower love and beg for the swift return of <a href="http://www.streetdirectory.com">Streetdirectory.com</a>, for without which we are simply lost in the wilderness of Singapore's urbanity. With all this love floating around, we're sure you guys will want to feel safe whilst practicing all this free loving, and such safety comes easily with Gadget Track, software that you can use to track your PC down, when you lose your laptop all you have to do is activate it and the programme will try to phone home. You may also want to keep all those naughty, naked, sprawled out on that carpet pictures of your Macbook safe, with EasySafe. Which is simply a key to all your sensitive files. </p>
<p>With <strong>Love and Adoration</strong><br />
Farinelli, That guy you checked out last night, asked for his twitter, gmail, FB, Myspace etc. etc., and realised that he's too hot for you anyway<br />
NTT, that guy who checked you out last night, and you felt a familiar stirring in your... Thinkpad<br />
Jerrick, You just want him coz he's that extra special 65th bit<br />
Kai-Yi, You know you want a guy who drives a Lamborghini in Gran Turismo 5 Prologue</p>
