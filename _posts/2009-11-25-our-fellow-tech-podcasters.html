<p>Since Michael Foong was on <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2009/11/24/65bits-episode-145-preview-is-the-new-beta/">65bits last week</a>, we thought we'd take the opportunity to share with you some of the other tech-related podcasts from some of Tech65's friends.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/TWiA-logo.gif" alt="This Week In Asia" /><br />
<strong><a href="http://thisweekinasia.net/">This Week In Asia</a></strong><br />
This is a podcast by our friends Bernard Leong (from <a href="http://sgentrepreneurs.com/">SGentrepreneurs</a>), Michael Foong and a few others where they chat about the latest, hottest and interesting tech news that dominate the entire landscape of Asia every week. Much like 65bits, but think the whole of Asia. You'll hear a lot more about places like China on that show, something that you don't hear discussed much today as far as podcasts are concerned. If you're interested in developments beyond our shores, especially in countries like China, that's a good show to catch.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://matechulous.com/">theITChannel</a></strong><br />
This is another podcast by Michael Foong. theITChannel is best explained as the 65bits of Malaysia. If you live across the causeway from us, that's a show you might wanna watch out for.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://theory.isthereason.com/?page_id=2191">TheoryCast</a></strong><br />
Kevin Lim, the friendly social cyborg, has been a <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2007/07/31/ep1-interview-with-kevin-lim/">long</a> <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2007/09/23/ep9-the-ipod-touch/">time</a> <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2008/12/27/kevin-lims-cameo-65bits-100th-episode-event/">supporter</a> of Tech65 and our shows, so how can we miss out his show, the TheoryCast? Kevin talks a lot about social media and technology on his blog, <a href="http://theory.isthereason.com">Theory.IsTheReason.com</a>, and the TheoryCast is his video version of that blog, where he covers talks that he conducts, interviews as well as geeky moments too. That's another cool show to check out.</p>
<p>One thing the four of us have in common (Tech65, TWiA, theITChannel and Kevin) is that we're all driven by passion for the field we talk about. People like Kevin and the individuals over at TWiA have supported us all this while since we began several years ago, and as members of this small community, it's only right that we give them our support as well. So do check out their shows, especially if they cover an area that you're interested in!</p>
