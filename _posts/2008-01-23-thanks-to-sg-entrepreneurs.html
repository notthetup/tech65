<p>Long time listener and contributor <a href="http://bleongcw.typepad.com/">Bernard Leong</a> and his team over at <a href="http://sgentrepreneurs.com/">SG Entrepreneurs</a> have made public their <a href="http://sgentrepreneurs.com/innovation-technology/2008/01/22/podcast-tech65-the-macworld-show/">decision to support Tech65</a> by promoting the latest episodes of 65bits, to bring the latest happenings and trends in technology to their readers. Tech65 would like to thank him and his team for their support, and promise to devote more airtime to technology instead of ever-deviating to cars, girls and Pokemon Pearl.</p>
<p>Nahhhhh kidding. You know we can't help it. :) No but still, thank you. Very much. Appreciate it.</p>
