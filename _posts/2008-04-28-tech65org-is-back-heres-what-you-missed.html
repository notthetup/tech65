<p>Hi everyone!<br />
Tech65.org is finally back online for SingNet users! We've put together a compilation of all the episodes of Channel65 and 65bits that you probably have missed just for you!</p>
<p><strong>What Happened</strong><br />
If you are a SingNet user, we apologise for the downtime Tech65.org has been having the past few weeks. Something happened over at SingNet that prevented SingNet users from accessing the website unless you had set up your computer to manually connect to SingNet's proxy server or DNS server. We have been working hard the past few weeks trying to figure out what was wrong, but after a phone call with SingNet, they finally fixed the connection at their side and brought the website back online. On behalf of the Tech65.org crew, I want to thank all of you for your patience, and thank SingNet for their assistance.</p>
