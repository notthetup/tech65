<p>Daniel, NTT, Nicole and I just attended the Nokia comes with music & Nokia 5800 launch party at the Velvet Underground last Friday. The phone looks good although its still early for us to comment much since we didn't really play with it for long. (And also the focus that night was more on Nokia comes with music) </p>
<p>But less than a week after the launch in Singapore, there has been reports that the <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2009/03/nokias_5800_xpr.html">Nokia 5800 is having some 3G signal issue in America</a>. In New York City, users complained of the 5800's inability to find AT&T's 3G network. <a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2009/02/28/our-nokia-5800-magically-starts-working-on-3g/">Engadget</a> also experienced the same issues for a day. While it is still unknown whether the fault lies with Nokia or AT&T network, we understand that 5800 has been pulled off the shelf in NYC store.</p>
<p>We contacted Nokia & Text100 (Nokia's PR company in Singapore) for their comments about this issue. The spokesperson told us that this is an isolated problem concerning only the North American market and is not specific to any other region or country. Nokia is currently investigating the matter further to find a quick remedy to the situation.</p>
<p>Which means it should be safe to get the Nokia 5800 in Singapore since the problem is only with the North American set. Singapore Nokia 5800 comes with music, not 3G issues. (Pun intended)</p>
