<p>Shortly after reviewing the <a href="http://nicole.sg/archives/review-palm-treo-pro/">Palm Treo Pro</a>,  I got the Palm Centro to review :) Many thanks to Samantha from Fleishman-Hillard for loaning the set to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/j6SyxALyeOhxkWsZs5LPMw?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/100CASIO1.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Again, I feature another collage of the various photos I took of the Palm Centro. :)</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>My grouse was Treo Pro running Windows Mobile, but I was duper happy when the Palm Centro came running Palm OS! Woohoo~!</p>
<p>That being said, let me go on with the rest of the review :)</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nicole.wongyuejun/PalmCentro?feat=embedwebsite#5290391180475242962"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CIMG0141.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The Palm Centro looks similar to the Treo Pro, or rather vice versa, though the centro featured a more tightly squeezed qwerty keyboard compared to the Treo Pro.</p>
<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nicole.wongyuejun/PalmCentro?feat=embedwebsite#5290391775620039634"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CIMG0142.JPG" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The stylus is nicely hidden at the back, and blends into the design pretty well. One has to remove the stylus prior to inserting the SIM card. Do take note that there is also a memory slot to insert the memory card, which also uses the micro SD.</p>

<p>The side of the phone allows one to toggle the volume of calls almost immediately, and is responsive.</p>
<p>During the period of using the Palm Centro, I didn't make use of the stylus, because the touch screen is so responsive that I could get all my tasks done much quicker.</p>
<p>The user interface is simple, and its user-friendly that I adapted to it almost immediately, because yours truly is also a huge palm fan, having used their old-school models ages ago...</p>
<p>The sms interface is intuitive, and strings the messages in the form of conversation between you and the recipient, making it easy to keep track of what has been said.</p>
<p>The qwerty keypad makes it a joy to type out the text and numbers, despite that the keys are so closely placed to each other.</p>
<p>Despite looking a little thick, the Palm Centro is rather light to hold and to be placed in pockets or the bag. It weighs about 100 g.</p>
<p>The music playback ain't fantastic, and the same can be said for the camera quality. Oh, it doesn't have wifi capability.</p>
<p>But the phone has quite a good interface for one to organize all that appointments and schedule etc... Not to mention that  these data can be sync back to your workstation, and you will never have to lose your precious data.</p>
<p>The Palm Centro is available in Black too. :) Check out the full specs <a href="http://www.palm.com/sg/products/smartphones/centro/specs.html">here</a></p>
<p>Overall, the Palm Centro is very easy to use, and all the information can be accessed very easily... and it helps to organize my daily hectic life. :)</p>
