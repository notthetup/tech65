<p><a title="Apple iPod nano (red) - Apple.com" class="imagelink" href="http://www.tech65.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/appleipodnanored.jpg"><img align="left" alt="Apple iPod nano (red) - Apple.com" id="image10" title="Apple iPod nano (red) - Apple.com" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/appleipodnanored.thumbnail.jpg" /></a>This just in! The red iPod nano has FINALLY arrived in Singapore. I think it's really pretty, don't you think? It'll make a perfect christmas gift *hint hint*. This special edition iPod is part of the "Product red" project. This means that for every red nano you buy, they'll donate a certain amount to help find a cure for AIDS. It's S$348 for the 4GB model and S$428 for the 8GB model.</p>
