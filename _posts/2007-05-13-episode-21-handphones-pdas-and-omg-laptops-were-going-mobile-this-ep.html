<p>Hello, My Lovelies.</p>
<p>Today's episode is special for us, as it is a coming of age episode of sorts. We receive revelations from various bodies such as Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Dopod and Palm. Hewlett Packard in its infinate wisdom has decided to unveil to us lowly unworthies several of their new laptops and given our lack of time we are only able to mention two of them. Zune news arrives along with Xbox 360 Dashboard updates and finally we reveal exactly how big a geek our dear Daniella is.</p>
<p>Forever Yours,<br />
Jan and Der</p>
