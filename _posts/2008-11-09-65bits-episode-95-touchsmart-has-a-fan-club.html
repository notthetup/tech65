<p>This week's recording was a race against time because we weren't at our usual location, and had a dying laptop and no power plug. This week's recording also successfully proved that we're in the pre-Christmas lull, that equally magical window of the year where 3 weeks worth of stories turn out to be less than one week's usual worth. Well you'll see the other extreme real soon. HP released Touchsmart's codes to developers, Windows 7 is shown off at PDC and it looks promising, and Starhub <em>malu-ated</em> as they fail to deliver their declaration of all Singaporean telcos selling the iPhone by the end of this year.</p>
