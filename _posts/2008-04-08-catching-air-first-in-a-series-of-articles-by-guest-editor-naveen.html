<p>This, the first in possibly a series of articles by a friend of our humble website, Naveen. Comment up!</p>
<p>When Apple announced there was something in the Air, it wasn't the only one. Adobe recently launched its own lightweight cross-platform runtime, also named AIR. Deceptive pun indeed, it expands to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime">Adobe Integrated Runtime</a>. What does it do?</p>
<p>Well firstly, AIR itself can be thought of as an emulator. It emulates in this case browser technology. Once the basic runtime is installed, AIR applications can be downloaded [the proverbial ROMs] and you can run them on any platform with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">AIR installed</a>, be it Mac, Windows and Linux [coming soon].<br />
What's special about AIR is that it emulates a browser [WebKit rendering, the same technology as Safari and Opera], and it follows that AIR applications are Rich Internet Applications, similar to Firefox extensions, only now masquerading as fullblown applications on your desktop.<br />
The applications can be written in any web language, Flash or even Adobe Flex.</p>
<p>People usually dismiss the potential of Rich Internet Applications, I find, but with the advent of the Software as a Service paradigm, rich Internet applications are no-install, quick-deploy shock troops in the Internet realm now. Visit any page with even a teeny bit of Javascript and that's lite programming at work. The benefits are undeniable; most of the interactivity you now see on webpages is asynchrous and you customise the page and services you want with minimal fuss server-side. The processor power and bandwidth they save empowers them to offer the same services to more people, with lesser downtime.</p>
<p>While the AIR concept sounds similar to <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a>, the fundamental difference is the need for a browser for the latter. Google Gears only caches the database data with SQLite and simulates a server-side environment so your online service [like Google Reader] works offline. In terms of functionality, I'd say AIR is similar to Microsoft's Silverlight and the not yet released Mozilla Prism.</p>
<p>I haven't tried too many AIR applications; there aren't very many available right now. Just under 50 AIRplications available in the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=productHome&exc=24">Marketplace</a> [a misnomer; they're all free!] and not every one of them is going to appeal to everyone. What I can recommend to you, in this Youtube age, is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&loc=en_us&extid=1355018">RichFLV</a>.<br />
This app has liberated me, changed how I work with .flv files that I routinely download from the Internet.<br />
It offers rich editing [true cut and paste] and rearragements of Cuepoints, exporting of the audio track to mp3 form, taking screenshots, converting the flv to SWF format; all this and more without breaking a sweat. If nothing else, it's a responsive offline FLV player. Highly recommended!</p>
<p>Other apps worthy of download would be <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&loc=en_us&extid=1314019">CleVR Stitcher</a> [allows quick stitching of photos to make a panorama], <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&loc=en_us&extid=1406018">MeeBone</a> [Meebo for the desktop; MSN connectivity without the bloatware!] and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&loc=en_us&extid=1374021">Fotobooth</a> [named after Apple's Photobooth with pretty much the same functionality].</p>
<p>If you couldn't tell by now, most of these applications occupy niche areas, in true scratch-an-itch fashion. And by leveraging their strongest suit, these AIRplications finally bring you the power of mashups to the desktop without the bulk of traditional equivalents. Hats off, Adobe.<br />
