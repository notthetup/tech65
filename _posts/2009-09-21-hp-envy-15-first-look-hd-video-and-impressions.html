<p>At the HP Fall 2009 launch event in Singapore, HP announced the HP Envy 15, a new premium notebook that resulted from their acquisition of Voodoo.</p>
<p>Jerrick and I had a conversation about the HP Envy just last night, and we realised that the Envy 15 might just do very well.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>While most of you can't tell what's so special about the Envy's design, those of us who were at the launch itself would agree that the HP Envy was really a beautiful machine. Sure, it looks just like a Macbook Pro, from the metal casing, the glass-to-the-edge display, the black hinge, all the way to the button-less touch pad. However, if I had to choose between a Macbook Pro and the HP Envy 15 strictly based on design, I'd go with the HP Envy. Something about the design just makes it look really beautiful and expensive.</p>
<p>Then there's the specifications on the Envy 15. They're not in the video, but here's the official list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Future, yet-to-be-announced processor based on the Intel Core i7</li>
<li>ATI Hobility Radeon HD 4830 with 1GB GDDR3 VRAM</li>
<li>15.6" Full HD (1920 x 1080) LED backlit HP Ultra Brightview Display</li>
<li>Up to 16GB of 1066MHz DDR3 RAM with Dual Channel Memory Support</li>
<li>Pretty insanse Hard Drive options (Single SSD 320GB / Dual SSD: 160GBx2 / SSD 160GB + HDD 250GB 5400RPM / HDD 250GB or 320GB or 500GB 7200RPM)</li>
<li>VGA Nightvision Webcam with IR LED for illumination</li>
<li>Beats Internal speakers</li>
<li>HDMI-out, eSATA port</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, they did leave out some things as well, namely the optical drive, and a VGA port (you need to get an HDMI to VGA adapter)</p>
<p>Then finally, it's not difficult to build the most powerful machine in the world, but it's difficult to do it while making it relatively affordable. According to the official press, the HP Envy 15 will begin sale from October 22, 2009, with a starting price of US$1899 (or S$2700). If the base model already has the new Intel chip, the ATI graphics cards and the HD display, it's going to be a really attractive machine to buy.</p>

<p>Now, if only this thing could run Mac OS X...</p>
