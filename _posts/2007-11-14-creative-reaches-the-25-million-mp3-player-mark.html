<p>Creative today announced with much pleasure that they have hit the 25million unit mark in MP3 player sales.</p>
<p>"Shipment of 25 million MP3 players marks a major milestone in Creative history, as our player unit volume exceeds the combined unit sales from some of the biggest names in consumer electronics," said Sim Wong Hoo, chairman and CEO of Creative. "We believe that we now have our strongest lineup of MP3 and portable media players ever, as we coutinue to innovate with our recently introduced ZEN Stone, ZEN Stone Plus, and the credit card-sized ZEN."</p>
<p>Â Tech65 is proud to be working with Creative, and heartily congratulate them on being recognised as number two in global unit shipments in the IDC March 2007 report on worldwide and U.S. flash and HDD-based portable media player shipments. We are curious, however, as to who managed to bump Creative out of first place.</p>
