<p>Some of the Tech65 crew were attending <a href="http://singapore.twestival.com/" target="_blank">Twestival</a>, the local tweet-up aimed at raising money for charity, when Daniel and Justin noticed an HP Mini 5101 on a table there. Without hesitation, we tried to dig up as much as we could regarding the HP Mini, and filmed it. Then we asked for permission... :P</p>
<p>This video was so ad-hoc, so unplanned that we had to rush through it as I didn't have enough memory left in my camera. That's why the video gets cut of abruptly at the end. Hope you enjoyed it!</p>
<p>Thanks Melvin! And for those who were there, hope you had fun at Twestival!</p>
