<p>We have an exciting lineup this week. NTT skyped in from Sweden. We also have another Daniel joining us this week, which means we have 2 Daniel and 2 Justin. And of course we have DK and Nicole too. The stories this week aren't as exciting as the lineup. We discuss about the Creative MediaBook, which nobody have seen the picture yet. Crunchpad, which none of us here have played with it. And Motorola DRIOD which we aren't getting yet.</p>
<p>And we are recording at our new found home, 8 Shenton Way Starbucks. (Formally Temasek Tower) So pop by every Saturday at around 10am if you want to join us. (Check out our twitter account in case there is any change in time/venue)</p>
