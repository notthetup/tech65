<p>Hello my lovelies, This week our guest star, the wonderful Justin Lee, who lives in Canada but has returned to our tropical heat sink of an island just for us, for US... MUAHAHAHAHA. This episode we talk about Zunes which are trying to be cool by tattooing itself, being all divaish, and demanding a factory for itself. We talk about Halo 3, Starcraft <strike>III</strike> (sic) II *Ed: JERRICK!!!!!* And the eastern iteration of AOE III. HELP its the attack of the Sequels!!! We have a new old Macbook, and an old new IBM. We also see how Microsoft has succeeded-ish with Vista and how Sony is failing-ish with the PS3. And plenty of other sidenotes that Justin gracefully introduced to us!  Till next week guys!</p>
<p>Jonic, Duckles, and Dr Egghead.</p>
