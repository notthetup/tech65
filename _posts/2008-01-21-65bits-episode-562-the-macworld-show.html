<p>Good Morrow, Ye fair ladies and gents from all the multiple counties and boroughs. The annual event that is Macworld has come around again, and with it the dearest bringer of good tidings and great innovation. He has announced in his own certain way, the arrival of a new addition to the Macbook line, the Macbook Air. He's introduced the concept of taking possession of a movie for a small period of time. In which time one is expected to be entertained as one would a jester that comes and leaves during the midsummer fete. I thank ye, for kindest attention, and look most forward till next we meet.</p>
<p>Kisses,<br />
Jerrick the Random Song Burster, Bernard the Spoken and Daniel the Dancer.</p>
