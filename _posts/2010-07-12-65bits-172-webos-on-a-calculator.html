<p>Horror!!! HP CEO said that they didn't buy Palm to be in the smartphone business!!! OH NO!!! What is going to happen to Palm? HELP!!!! But thanks to the super delayed 65bits posting, we now know that the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/03/hp-says-its-in-the-smartphone-market-after-all/">HP isn't going to let the Palm Smartphone business die</a>. There are definitely more webOS smartphones on the way. *Fingers crossed*</p>
<p>On other news, sightings of a new 7 inch tablet by Samsung called the Samsung Galaxy Tab which looks just like the Samsung Galaxy S upsized. No news on what Samsung is going to do with it yet or when will we see it on the shelf. Let's hope soon. And cheers to all AT&T iPhone users who are finally getting internet tethering, at a small monthly fee.</p>
<p>And yes, the Hamster is still trying to catch up on the 65bits editing. Please bear with it for a moment.</p>
