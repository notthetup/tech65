<p>The background story to this is that my uber cool earphones have spoilt, and I was looking to get a set to tide me over while they get sent back to the beautiful motherland of China to be replaced.</p>
<p>Originally, having for a long time before experienced the goodness of the Creative's signature budget earphones, the EP-630, I was going to zoom in straight for that - I wasn't in the mood for experimenting about with funny new models this time round. But at the peripherals store I walked into, hanging tantalizingly beside the rack of 630s were the rack of Metro.fi 10o. I must confess that I am ashamed of even looking at them (and subsequently buying a pair omg?) because as an aficionado of quality music (yes, I am trying to avoid naming myself an audiophile), I have immense respect for the Ultimate Ears brand, and watched in horror as Logitech tore it apart with these cheap budget product lines after it bought the company over. But something just came over me and in a decision I am still trying to comprehend myself, I purchased both sets.</p>
<p>The result of all this frivolous spending is that you my dear reader finally have a good post to help you decide for a budget pair of earphones.</p>
<p>[gallery link="file" columns="4"]</p>

<p>Specs-wise, the 100 seems to have a very slight edge over the 630. One of the most important strengths of the 100 is the fabric exterior of the wire - this I foresee helps sidestep tangling and tearing issues that often come when one is too rough on rubber-protected wires, or even the higher end twisted acrylic wires. The 100 also comes with a rather hardy case (keeping the S$49 price tag in mind), and a cord tightener (I think you call it) for more fitted usage (sports and such). You can see quite plainly from the gallery above how the casing is useful yet again for tangle prevention, and I'm pretty sure I remember a movable piece on the 630's cord, but again, the rubber breaks after awhile so they might have just given up and removed it. Perhaps the only thing more important than anti-tangling is the ergonomics of actually wearing the earphones, which 630 breezes past with its simple and practical stemmed design, and which the 100 fails quite tremendously at with its oftentimes awkwardly worn buds. But since it's the ear we are talking about here, I believe a lack of ergonomy won't make much of a difference since no active muscles are involved, unlike the design of mice or keyboards for example where ergonomics play a huge role in easing strain to wrist muscles.</p>
<p>Sound-wise however, I knew I should have just gone with my experience, instead of trying to guess whether the 100 might compare. That said, the 100 doesn't lag that far behind the 630, and may very well be your preferred choice if you agree with the points I'm about to share regarding its audio output.</p>
<p>The 630 presents what I call a Rock EQ - a valley-shaped tuning graph. The bass, which they never fail to shout about on the packaging, lends a very solid foundation to your music without being overbearing. The response to short beats like kick drums aren't as firm and snappy as one would like it to be, but 1) at this price no one should expect it to anyway and 2) the majority of users probably won't appreciate the effort anyway (sounds bad since I'm most probably talking about you, but if punchy bass is that important to you, go look at some 3-digit-priced earphones). The treble has clarity and yet manages to avoid (most of the time anyway) the ear-piercing sharpness that earphones of lesser quality generate. These two points are the twin pillars of strength for the 630, and remain so only because Creative managed to put them together seamlessly.</p>
<p>The soundstage (the virtual expanse created by the projection of sound) of the 630 is a little wide, which sometimes creates a welcome illusion of a grand performance in a great concert hall or a headbanging gig in some stadium, but also can make your music sound unnaturally distant. Again, it's nothing that would make you fling the earphones down in disgust, but still a point to note, in case you think your unit's faulty.</p>
<p>In contrast, the 100's soundstage takes a far more no-nonsense, direct approach, piping music laterally into your ears. Some will appreciate this direct feed of sound, because it will help enhance stereo effects.</p>
<p>The sound quality however, doesn't leave me quite impressed. In typical Ultimate Ears fashion, they decided to tune the drivers to push the low-mids frequency (most often generated by lower male voices and distorted/overdriven guitars), which is extremely tricky business - far more tricky than a good bass or treble compromise. Quite obviously, they failed, and fell into the age-old trap of generating slightly muddy (muffled) music instead. The bass is slightly more encompassing than the 630, but looser as well (kinda drops on you like bouncy jelly if you know what I mean), and the treble is barely acceptable.</p>
<p>But like I said earlier in this post, you may like such a sound signature (I did previously), and the best way to find out is not only to read, but to try it out yourself. Both the 630 and 100 should be freely available to try at Stereo Electronics, at either Compass Point or Plaza Singapura.</p>
<p>Creative and Ultimate Ears are very reputed brands in the consumer audio field. One built its way up from the ground and another reached down from the lofty heavens to be with mortals. In their own right, both pairs of earphones are decent. But like I advise everyone who asks me to recommend a pair of earphones, no one else can hear for you, and you have to listen for yourself to ascertain the pair that best suits you.</p>
<p>Or you know. You could just take a leap of faith.</p>
