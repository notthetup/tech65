<p>Disclaimer: This episode is not suitable for people sensitive to certain topics. Listen at your ownÂ discretion.</p>
<p>We have Farinelli with us in this episode. We talk about what happened with the national service pay and some *ahem* news reporting from Farinelli. He tells us about how he gets turned on, and lastly we talk about how DK is volunteering to walk from Boon Lay to Pasir Ris for charity!</p>
<p>So without further ado, please email us if you're interested to assist in our charity walk.</p>
