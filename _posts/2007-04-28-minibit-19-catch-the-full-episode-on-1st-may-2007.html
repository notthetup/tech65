<p>As you all know, Jerrick's away on holiday, and unfortunately, our new guys aren't free today, so episode 19 will be until May Day next tuesday, so do stay tuned! In the meantime, here's some of the headlines this week. The Nintendo Wii is finally launched in Singapore! For those of you who want to buy it now, it's sold at 649 in a bundle which includes the console, an extra wii remote and sonic the hedgehog game. By the way, comics connection is selling the console by itself for 499. You'll have to make reservations though, because the stock is already sold out, but will be replenished next week. Also, Blizzard is going to be announcing a new product on the 19th May. What are they announcing? We have no idea, but we can always speculate. All this and more, on episode 19 of 65 bits!</p>
