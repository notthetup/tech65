<p>This is Fresh, the show where you get the freshest take on gadgets in Singapore! While Gear65 lets you have a close look at gadgets you love to play with, Fresh gives you our take on the experience the gadgets have given us so far.</p>
<p>In our first episode, we talk about Sony Ericsson's latest line-up of smartphones, and their first attempt into the Android space.</p>
<p>Just like Simply Geek, do give us your feedback. For a start we are aware of 2 issues: the length (as usual) and the Skype audio quality. We aim to solve these two together, as the audio quality goes down with time (we blame Starhub for that, which has given us problems with Skype consistently). Our target is to keep the show less than 20 minutes, and based on this show, which tackled 4 gadgets, we think it is possible if we don't talk about more than 1 gadget per episode. This would also make each episode more focused as well.</p>
<p>But do send us your feedback. Fresh at Tech65 dot org is the show's dedicated email address.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>- Daniel, Farinelli, Justin Lee</p>
