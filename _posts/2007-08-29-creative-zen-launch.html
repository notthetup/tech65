<p>We were told a while back that they're gonna be launching a new product today at Geek Terminal, so we're right here hoping that they'll let us crash the party. What do you think? Will they let us?<br />

We're gonna keep updating this page, so keep refreshing this page for more.</p>
<p><strong>8:51 AM</strong> Turns out that the product is all over the internet already.<br />

<strong>9:04 AM</strong> They're decorating Geek Terminal with pictures of the ZEN all over the place. I guess it won't be an Apple style press launch, but a press announcement.<br />

<strong>9:25 AM</strong> It's getting pretty busy inside, but we're still not sure if we can go in for the event.<br />
<strong>9:33 AM</strong> Noooooooo.... They closed the door on us!!! *sniff sniff*<br />
<strong>11:00 AM</strong> The event just ended, but we're still stuck outside.<br />
<strong>12:03 PM</strong> We managed to get in! Turns out we could have gone in along. We're recorded some footage of the new player. Stay tuned!</p>
