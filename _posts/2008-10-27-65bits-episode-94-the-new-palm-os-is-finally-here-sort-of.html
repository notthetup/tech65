<p>Did you guys go check out X08 last weekend? Well, we did, and we got a chance to play with the new Xbox Experience, the upcoming software update for the 360, and we loved it.</p>
<p>Also, we just can't get enough of Mobile tech news, as shown in this week's episode where we explore Firefox's mobile browser that just got released as an alpha, and talk about Android some more. What's that? The "we-waited-so-long-until-we-didn't-care-anymore" Palm OS 6 that they promised to release in 2004 (!?) is finally launched as ALP? Right. And moving swiftly along...</p>
