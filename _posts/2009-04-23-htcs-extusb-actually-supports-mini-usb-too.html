<p><span>DK and I made an interesting discover with this HTC phone we were playing. Out of curiosity, we tried to plug in an ordinary mini USB cable into the port, and without any difficulty at all, as if it was designed to, the mini USB cable plugged right into the port, providing both power and data!</span></p>
<p>Hmmm....</p>
<p><span>In fact, after doing some reading up, it turns out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExtUSB#Proprietary_connectors_and_formats" target="_blank">this was intentional</a> after all! The idea is that with a normal mini USB cable, you can charge and sync your HTC device, but with an ExtUSB cable, you can have audio/video input and output thanks to 6 extra pins! In essence, this is a "best-of-both-worlds" design, since you can just bring a single mini USB cable to connect all your USB devices (bonus if you have a mini USB to micro USB adapter, which I have) as well as to charge them all, and yet still support more powerful proprietary accessories thanks to the 6 extra pins! Consumers win!<br />

<p><span>After this discovery, I just fell in love with HTC's smartphones a little more...<br />
