<p>Lenovo recently launched their latest line-up of PCs – the industry’s slimmest 27-inch IdeaCentre A720 All-in-One (AIO) equipped with the quad-core 3rd  Generation Intel® Core™ processors and coupled with Lenovo Enhanced Experience 3 (EE 3) for Windows 7.</p>
<p>As the industry’s slimmest 27-inch AIO, the IdeaCentre A720 sports a sleek metal exterior and is a mere 24.5mm, thinner than a typical club sandwich. Its frameless display screen supports 10-point multi-touch. The improved AIO design is engineered to optimize the touch experience in the ‘digital’ home by allowing a widely adjustable hinge screen to be pulled towards the user at an angle of -5o and folded back to an angle of up to 90o. This foldable screen makes touch applications more comfortable to use and maneuver especially over longer periods of time.</p>
<p>Offering extraordinary graphics performance powered by NVIDIA® GeForce® graphics, the desktop comes with up to 1TB HDD and 64 GB SSD storage. The A720 support multi-user scenarios with greater accuracy over its touch experience while delivering an impressive home multimedia experience on a frameless high definition 16:9 widescreen. Integrated with entertainment features, such as room-shaking Dolby Home Theatre V4 audio, Lenovo High-Sense (720p HD) Webcam, and Lenovo IdeaTouch (a suite of touch-optimized applications and games), the A720 is an ultra stylish and fun addition to the modern home’s entertainment centre.</p>
