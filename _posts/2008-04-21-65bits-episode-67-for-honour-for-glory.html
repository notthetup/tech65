<p>Those of you out there who still've been unable to access our site, we encourage you to blog up! and Blog OUT! Your words, those keystrokes, will be put to great use, for it will honour us greatly! Onto more pressing issues. Those honourable ones who will listen to those words that've been prophesied, that there will be one who shall challenge the gods, the mighty Steveness, the God-King of all Techdom, he whose wrath has been that of legend and disaster. We also speak of a tiny laptop, which has had many improvements made upon it, by the blacksmiths and potters of ASUS, it has now a greater screen of which to show us more, Windows has been added to make it a temptation upon your money-sack and now we can be sure that you shall be able to be Rock Solid, Heart Touching. Our sponsors GadgetTrak, and Easysafe are also those who would protect from from the evils of stolen data, of lost privacy, they will keep you safe and allow you to remain protected in your time of crisis.</p>
<p>With Great Strength<br />
