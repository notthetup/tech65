<p>We sent Jerrick down to the Samsung Galaxy S III Launch in London Earl's Court and he was also able to Live Tweet the event. Those of you who managed to catch those tweets, let us know what you think! This is the video that came from his limited time at the event and you can see that it's a really interesting device. Some of the features don't work as advertised yet, but we suspect that will change with the final versions. The screen truly is phenomenal and frankly, worth getting your hands on for a look. Samsung have really stepped up the game in terms of their software, as their hardware is pretty much as good as it gets, but all it needs now is some finishing. Really looking forward to some alone time with the device and being able to give you guys a review.</p>
<p>With Love from London,</p>
<p>Jerrick</p>
