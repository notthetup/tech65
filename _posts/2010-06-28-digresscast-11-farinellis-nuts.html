<p>Well, I think everyone's been waiting for this episode for the past 6 months. It is finally out. DigressCast will be resuming its regular podcasting season. Now for the episode itself. We had a somewhat long discussion about our favourite Tech65 crew Farinelli, how and why he got his nickname. You might want to brace yourself for a ride of your life, because this episode is just so funny, your nuts will drop... literally.</p>
<p>Now you know the story.</p>
