<p>So we are scheming liars, who decided to inflict upon the world another one of our fabuloso podcasts. Gizmodo denied us the pleasure of announcing to the world our all consuming loyalty to His Steveness, Apple broke our hearts but decided to atone for its sins by giving cash to a guy with big glasses, Taiwan shows us how to move, and Jerrick raves about Pokemon, which we all know at the age of 18 is a sign of dementia or too much wine last night. Happy New Year folks, Daniel and J-Thingymajiggy sommat or other.</p>
