<p>M1 joins the "Telco selling iPhone" club while the guys in green are still nowhere to be seen. The crews talks about E-Books again although I think most of them aren't avid readers. We also discuss about the latest "feature" on Snow Leopard which deletes all your user data when you use the guest login. There is a new Google wave invite scam that is going around and quite a number of Techie people fell for it.</p>
<p>And I would like to say again that Justin and Fari's opinion does not represent Tech65. Neither does DK and Nicole. But if that it the case, then whose opinion does? Hmmmm......</p>
<p>DK, Farinelli, Justin, Nicole</p>

<p>PS: Sorry for the huge delay. The Tech65 hamsters are having some problems lately. Barnes and Noble has since <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/20/barnes-and-noble-nook-dual-screen-reader-officially-launched">launched their E-book reader</a>. My fault for the delay. I promise I'll stop feeding the hamsters with McNuggets and Hoegaarden.</p>
