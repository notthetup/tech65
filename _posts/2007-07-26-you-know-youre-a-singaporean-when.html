<p>Hey ho people-os! A shout to all our viewers, especially the <a href="http://ping.sg/">Ping.sg</a> crowd!</p>
<p>National Day's Coming in Two, that's RIGHT two weeks time! And we, the creative directors, cast, crew, members of staff, Important persons and very Important persons at <em>65 Bits</em> would like to know what you think makes you a Singaporean! Post your suggestions in the comment form below, and we'll pick the best few and read it out on our show (Episode 33).</p>
<p>We're modelling it after the classic "You know you're..." jokes, so do submit your suggestion(s) in that format. And now to leave you with examples and a lighter heart, here are a couple of examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>You know you're a redneck when you think fast food is hitting a deer at 80 miles per hour.</li>
<li>You know you're a redneck when you work with your shirt off... and so does your husband.</li>
<li>You know you're Singaporean when you're kiasu, and you're kiasu about being kiasu.</li>
<li>You know you're Singaporean when you queue 5 hours... for a cat with no mouth.</li>
</ul>
