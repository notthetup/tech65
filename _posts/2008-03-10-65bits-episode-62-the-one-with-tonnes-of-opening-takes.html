<p>As the wind blows, so goes the time, and we have finally arrived at such time that the great one, His Steveness, has deigned to provide us with an SDK we can use for the iPhone. We are also filled with a pleasant sensation that Apple has also decided to provide us Asians with the ability to print books, calendars and various other miscellany with the iPhoto printing program. We are also given a sense of general serenity that our computers will now be protected and saved with the coming of the program GadgetTrack for Windows, a piece of software that if used, will broadcast information of the location your stolen/misplaced computer, the next time someone tries to use it. Its easy, painless, and gives you the peace and serenity to remember that we are only human but technology can help save our delicate heinies.</p>
<p>With great positive energy flows,<br />
