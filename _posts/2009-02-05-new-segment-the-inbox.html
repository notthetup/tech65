<p>The crew here at Tech65 is known among all their friends at that "techie guy" who "knows everything about tech", and so many times have people approached us for tips on what and where to buy gadgets, how to fix problems, or do something on their computer. We're not really complaining. In fact, it's because of the satisfaction we got from helping people by answering their questions that have inspired us to start Tech65.</p>
<p>So we decided to encourage questions to us. So if you have a question on anything tech related (and by tech, we mean consumer electronics and the stuff we usually cover on Tech65), or even regarding something we have on our website, send us an email to <strong>The.Inbox@tech65.org</strong>, and we will do our best answer them. If we think the answer has value to our readers, we will also post the answer here! We can't promise that we can answer every single question though, but with 9 of us, I'm sure we'll do fine.</p>
<p>The.Inbox segment will also feature questions that people such as friends and collegues have asked us about tech during the week that we think you'll be able to learn something from. So get those emails sending! The more emails, the more we can share our knowledge with you, the more you can learn!</p>
