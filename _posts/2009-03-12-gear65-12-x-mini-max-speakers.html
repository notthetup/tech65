<p>Whenever we talk about small portable speakers, NTT (our audio engineer) would be the first to say they're surely going to sound bad because of their size. Strangely, when XMI showed him the X-Mini Max, he actually liked it! I mean, it's still nothing compared to those audiophile speakers out there, but for its size, it's actually really loud and clear! What do I like about them? The fact that they're small, that NTT likes them ( = quality), and most importantly, it's made and designed in Singapore!!</p>
