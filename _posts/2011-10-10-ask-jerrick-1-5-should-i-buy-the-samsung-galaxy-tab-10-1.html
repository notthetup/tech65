<p>In this episode, we look at the question asked the WORLD over. Should I or should I not buy a Tablet? More specifically should I or should I not buy a Samsung Galaxy Tab? And the answer is really quite simple! Unequivocabladbly ... Maybe! :D Watch this episode for more Ask Jerrick goodness and if you have any questions, drop them to me at @askjerrick or via email @ askjerrick@tech65.org</p>
<p>With Love and a touch of Lemongrass,<br />
Jerrick</p>
