<p>We found a friend who ordered the Google Nexus One and who was willing to let us do the unboxing on his behalf! So we went out and met him at the KFC over at the Lot1 shopping mall last night and unboxed it for him! Because of that, we didn't have the usual proper equipment or the best sound, but I'm sure you're not going to care, right? :P</p>
<p>By the way, this was also the first time we streamed the unboxing live over Ustream! We had about 15 people in the chat room asking us questions about the Nexus One, which we did our best to answer and show off on the spot. The whole event lasted for about an hour and half and was streamed entirely off an iPhone 3GS (and subsequently an HTC Hero)! We had a lot of fun and we'll try to do that more often in the future! So do follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tech65">our twitter feed</a> to be informed for things like that!</p>
