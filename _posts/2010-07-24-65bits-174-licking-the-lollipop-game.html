<p>It WAS the E3 week when we did the recording. But as you know, this another one of those delayed posting. The hamster have lots of catching up to do. Anyway, we discussed about the 3 big announcement from E3 THAT week. Nintendo showing off their Nintento 3DS which is a portable 3D handheld gaming device. Sony gave us more details on their upcoming Playstation Move. The most exciting news would be Microsoft Kinect which is formally called Project Natal. We also talk about how Apple changes their iOS SDK terms to allow Lua but still no Adobe Flash. And back to Singapore, the Government is planning on giving everyone an email account. So exciting. </p>

<p>[34:50] <strong>Bonus Material</strong>: A day with Justin Lee. </p>
<p>Maybe I should explain how this bonus material come about. As you all know, here at Tech65, we review lots of gadget. And since there are so many members, we usually pass the review unit around among the members so that those who are interested can get a few days of hands on. So what happen was that I passed Justin an Android phone after I'm done with my review. But I forgot to log out of my Google Latitude before passing the phone to him. And since I have my Google Latitude History enabled, I got a record of Justin's whereabout for a day. Wahahahahaha......</p>
