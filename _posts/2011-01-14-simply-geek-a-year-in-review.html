<p>We started the podcast Simply Geek about an year ago to quench our thirst for geeking out and just talking about geeky stuff among ourselves. Basically we needed an excuse to talk, and thought, "Hey, people might be interested in listening to this". With me being in Sweden, we decided to try to do it over <a href="http://skype.com">Skype</a>. We knew <a href="http://twit.tv">Leo Laporte</a> did it, but it had never worked well in Singapore. After a <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2009/12/21/simply-geek-ep0-5-a-new-hope/">few try-outs</a>, it worked.</p>
<p>Over the last 16 episodes we have covered everything from <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2010/06/04/simply-geek-9-%E2%80%93-starcraft-2/">Starcraft2</a> to <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2011/01/11/simply-geek-16-%E2%80%93-productivity-and-life-hacking/">Productivity</a> and we're hoping to continue these geeky discussions going forward (with Skype gods blessings ofcourse).</p>
<p>While I won't go into the details of our viewership, I would like to touch on the tech/production side of things that we have learnt doing Simply Geek. Here are some points.</p>
<p>1. Always pray to the Skype Gods. Since Simply Geek was always recorded over Skype, Skype HAD TO work.<br />
2. Test and re-test your setup for long lengths of time. There was once <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2010/10/26/simply-geek-12-%E2%80%93-libraries-ebooks-and-technology/">an episode where we had some audio issues</a> 10mins into the recording, which was impossible to notice while recording.<br />
3. iPhone headsets are awesome for Skype recordings. They're handy and omnipresent and way better than built-in laptop mics.<br />
4. Get the person with the best internet connection to start a Skype call. It yields the best quality.<br />
5. Try to record on multiple locations. Best if all involved parties record.<br />
6. Backup Backup Backup!!<br />
7. Wikipedia is your best friend for facts. NOT!<br />
8. Have a script and don't use it. Always good to know the general direction but doesn't have to be so strict.<br />
9. Keep a track of time. So that you don't have to <a href="http://www.tech65.org/2010/08/03/simply-geek-11-1-%E2%80%93-travelling-geeks-part-1/">split the shows</a>.<br />
10. Note down all the links mentioned for easy shownotes creation.</p>
<p>To continue with our geekery, we need your help to know what you want us to talk about on the future episodes of Simply Geek. As you know on Simply Geek, we take a geeky topic (doesn't have to be tech, anything geeky will do) and discuss on it with some guests who're enthusiastic about that topic. So it's always the topics and the guests which make great episodes. So, please feel free to recommend topics which you want to hear us discuss, and or guests you want to hear on Simply Geek by updating <a href="http://bit.ly/sgtopics">this spreadsheet</a> - http://bit.ly/sgtopics. We will use this to plan our future episodes.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, and we hope to keep bringing you awesome content which you want to listen to!</p>
<p>Njoy,</p>
