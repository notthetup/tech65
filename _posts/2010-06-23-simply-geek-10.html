<p>There's been a recent trend in the digital photography market, a new category of cameras that we recently discovered, while talking to our friends, are known as Mirrorless Cameras, or more precisely Electronic Viewfiender + Interchangeable Lens (i.e. EVIL) cameras.</p>
<p>So what's the deal with these cameras? Why is Olympus, Panasonic, Samsung, and more recently Sony, rushing to push such cameras out? Why not just get a DSLR? Speaking of which, what's the deal with a DSLR in the first place? What's a crop factor? We invited those friends of ours to answer our questions.</p>
<p>All this and more, on this week's knowledge filled episode that's Simply Geek.</p>
